# ARCHITECTURE.md — Doppl

> **Build contract.** This file is the binding source of truth for Doppl's design. Downstream skills (`/tasks-gen` → `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, the `/tdd` engine, `/check-arch`, cross-doc invariant tables) bind to the `§<N>` anchors and Appendix A here. It is loaded on demand by section, never whole. The implementer never edits it directly — cross-doc changes are flagged at `/tdd` Step 9 and the orchestrator writes them hot, in the same round of commits as the matching Appendix-A / model edit.

Lean build with explicit, *flagged* deferrals; do not expand into production-SaaS scope. **Load-bearing safety/correctness invariants are never cut regardless of posture:** hard energy/depth/spawn/tool/wall-clock caps + kill switch, an append-only authoritative event log, no arbitrary code execution, secrets never in prompts/events/traces, and a held-out fitness anchor the evolving agents cannot move.

## Executive summary

Doppl is an experimental **agental-evolution runtime**: a human seeds a run, Doppl spawns a bounded population of agent genomes ("agenomes"), the agenomes generate **candidate ideas**, an adversarial **critic council + objective checks** evaluate them, and high-fitness lineages survive, **fuse** (two-parent crossover + output synthesis), **mutate**, and produce later generations. The MVP proof is that a later generation produces stronger, more verifiable ideas than an earlier one — measured by a **held-out judge against a fixed rubric** — with lineage, energy, critic evidence, subtype checks, novelty, and fitness all visible in a live/replayable dashboard.

The system is a **custom TypeScript Doppl kernel** (the authoritative runtime; the "weird part" — population dynamics, energy metabolism, lineage, fusion, replay — is not bent into a workflow framework). The single source of truth is a **Postgres append-only run-event log**; every read model (current-state tables, dashboard projections, the lineage graph, Neo4j exports, SSE streams, Langfuse traces) is **derived and never authoritative**. Model access goes through a **provider-agnostic ModelGateway** (OpenRouter primary; direct OpenAI for embeddings and structured-output fallback; Anthropic via the same seam; a web-search/retrieval capability for critic grounding; Codex research-only). **Langfuse Cloud** provides LLM observability as a non-authoritative side channel with a local trace-metadata fallback. **Simple embedding-based novelty scoring** supplies anti-collapse pressure. **React Flow** renders the lineage dashboard; the API is **REST commands/queries + SSE** run-event streaming. Deployment is **local-first** (the demo of record) with hosted kept as a deferred seam. **Neo4j** is deferred from the runtime but gets an early, timeboxed lineage-analysis spike against a storage-agnostic projection. **SQLite is forbidden.**

The subsystems (§2.5) decompose along the four PRD ownership surfaces — **kernel/runtime, selection/ML, verifier council, demo/observability** — connected by an import-direction DAG whose only fan-out hub is the ModelGateway. The shared contracts (Appendix A) are frozen before tracks fork. The two reproduction levels and the held-out fitness anchor are the structural heart: the organism's reproduction is *fusion*, and its objective can evolve while its anchor cannot move.

> **Architecture sentence:** *It's not the agent — it's the kernel that breeds the agents; the event log is the truth, and the held-out judge is the floor the organism cannot lift.*

## §1 — Goals & non-goals

**Goals (must-ship):**
- Run bounded agental-evolution loops over **both** candidate-idea subtypes — `cross_domain_transfer` and `zeitgeist_synthesis` — on one shared lifecycle with subtype-specific checks (`REQ-F-001/002`).
- Spawn a bounded population (~20 agenomes target), seeded from a **human-authored gen-0 baseline** (`REQ-F-003/004`, `REQ-F-017`).
- **Fusion** reproduction at two levels: agenome-level crossover + output-level synthesis (`REQ-F-010`).
- An adversarial **critic council** with distinct mandates, **objective checks** where feasible, **novelty** scoring, and a **held-out judge + critic rotation** so the fitness target is not directly optimizable (`REQ-F-006/007/008`, `REQ-F-016`, `REQ-I-003`).
- Cull, select parents, mutate, and run a successor generation; show **gen N+1 beats gen N** on the held-out rubric (`REQ-F-009/011`, `REQ-E-001`).
- Preserve every lifecycle decision in an **append-only event log**; support **live + replay** modes with no fresh model calls on replay (`REQ-D-001`, `REQ-F-014`).
- An **instrumented dashboard**: population tree, energy per agenome, fitness-over-time, critic gauntlet, subtype-check evidence, final surviving idea, visible lineage specialization (`REQ-F-013`, `REQ-E-002/003/004`, `REQ-UX-001..003`).
- **Finite by construction**: hard caps on population/generations/energy/depth/tool-calls/wall-clock + kill switch (`REQ-NF-001`, `REQ-S-001`).
- Modular for 3–4 engineers across four ownership surfaces (`REQ-NF-004`).
- **Local-first** demo reliability with a rehearsable prepared problem set + replay fallback (`REQ-O-001/005`, `REQ-E-005`).

**Non-goals (deferred — see §18):** production SaaS accounts/workspaces/admin/rollback/long-term ops; open-ended multi-hour autonomous evolution; learned bandit/RL spawn allocation + learned value model/credit assignment; self-evolving critic council; in-house fine-tuning flywheel; weight-level model fusion; DPP/MAP-Elites quality-diversity; Neo4j as a runtime dependency; LangGraph as authoritative runtime; LangSmith; WebSocket-first control; SQLite.

## §2 — System overview

The runtime emits authoritative events to Postgres; everything the operator/audience sees is a projection of those events, streamed over SSE and queried over REST.

The kernel is the **only** subsystem that emits authoritative lifecycle decisions (generation start/complete, spawn, cull, reproduction, terminal states). Langfuse is for LLM trace/cost/eval visibility only; Neo4j, if used, consumes a derived lineage projection. Neither is ever consulted for replay truth.

## §2.5 — Subsystem dependency DAG & parallelization seams

**Import-direction rule:** dependencies point one way — `contracts → infrastructure ports → domain/runtime → projections → api → ui`. Domain/runtime modules import **shared contracts and infrastructure ports only** — never concrete provider SDKs, frontend code, or projection read models. Provider/retrieval adapters may import vendor SDKs; runtime sees only the `ModelGateway` port + `ProviderCapability` metadata. The dashboard reads API/projections and never mutates authoritative state. Projection builders consume the event log and emit derived read models; they never mutate historical events. The Neo4j spike consumes exported lineage data and is never authoritative. Nesting in the DAG implies nothing — **only an explicit edge is a dependency** (`A --> B` means "B depends on / imports from A").

```

**Independent tracks (no shared dependency path after the freeze).** Once `contracts`, a recorded/fake **ModelGateway stub**, and the **event-store schema** are frozen, these run concurrently with no edge between them:
- **(A) kernel/runtime** — `runtime-kernel`, `reproduction-fusion`, `event-store` writes.
- **(B) verifier council** — `verifier-council`, `check-runners`, retrieval grounding, held-out judge.
- **(C) selection/ML** — `selection-scoring`, novelty, fitness policy, idea-space embedding.
- **(D) demo/observability** — `projection-builders`, `backend-api`, `frontend-dashboard` (against fixture projections), `observability-adapter`.
- **(E)** `neo4j-spike` (against a sample lineage export).

The only edges crossing these groups converge at the **runtime owner's integration point** (the generation loop) and the **demo owner's integration point** (the live projection feed). **(B) and (C) are independent only after `model-gateway` + the candidate/check/score contracts are frozen** — the ModelGateway is a shared dependency of **3 of the 4 surfaces** (runtime, verifier, selection), so a stub gateway must exist before they fork.

**Surface ownership (maps to the PRD team table):**
| Surface | Owns (nodes) |
|---|---|
| Kernel / runtime | `contracts` (authoring lead), `runtime-kernel`, `reproduction-fusion`, `event-store`, ModelGateway integration |
| Selection / ML | `selection-scoring`, novelty, fitness policy, idea-space embedding |
| Verifier council | `verifier-council`, `check-runners`, retrieval grounding, evidence schemas, held-out judge |
| Demo / observability | `projection-builders`, `backend-api`, `frontend-dashboard`, `observability-adapter`, `neo4j-spike` |

**Shared contracts crossed by a DAG edge — freeze before tracks fork** (cross-track Finding if changed mid-build): `RunEventEnvelope`+`RunEventType`, `Agenome`, `CandidateIdea`+subtype payloads, `EvidenceRef`, `CriticReview`, `CheckResult`, `FitnessScore`+`ScoringPolicy`, `NoveltyScore`, `EnergyEvent`, `RunCaps`/`RunConfig`, `ModelGatewayRequest/Response`+`ProviderCapability`, `LineageGraphProjection`. (Full inventory: Appendix A.)

**Repo shape (resolved — adopt-with-flag).** A pnpm monorepo with import-rule-enforced boundaries (dependency-cruiser/eslint), **not** publishable packages: `packages/contracts` (frozen first, imported by every track), `apps/api` (runtime-kernel · event-store · model-gateway · verifier · check-runners · selection · reproduction · projections · REST/SSE), `apps/web` (dashboard + projections client), `packages/observability` (thin). Folder boundaries inside `apps/api` mirror the subsystem nodes. Promote a folder to its own package only if a clean publish boundary is later needed.

## §3 — Domain model & lifecycle state machines

**Canonical unit of work:** `CandidateIdea` (Appendix A), one of two subtypes sharing one lifecycle: `cross_domain_transfer` (map a technique from source domain A onto target problem B) and `zeitgeist_synthesis` (a thesis/framing fitted to current signals). Core entities (typed in Appendix A): `Run`, `Generation`, `Agenome`, `CandidateIdea`, `CriticReview`, `CheckResult`, `NoveltyScore`, `FitnessScore`, `EnergyEvent`, `ReproductionEvent`, `CullingEvent`, `LineageGraphProjection`.

**Shared lifecycle:** seed run → spawn bounded population → generate candidates → normalize to the shared schema → critic council → subtype checks (or `skipped` w/ reason) → novelty → fitness (incl. **held-out judge**) → cull weak lineages → fuse + mutate strong parents → next generation → present final surviving idea with replayable evidence.

**Relationships:** a run has many generations; a generation has many agenomes; an agenome has 0–2 parents (fusion offspring usually 2; gen-0 has none); an agenome creates ≥0 candidates; a candidate has one subtype, many critic reviews, ≥0 check results, and one selected fitness score per scoring-policy version. Lineage changes are *events*, never mutable parent/child rewrites.

### State machines (the kernel enforces all four; gap-fixes folded in)

```text
Run:        configured → running → completing → completed
            configured → running → stopping → stopped
            running → failed            (execution error / wall-clock / kill)
            configured → cancelled
            * terminal = completed | stopped | failed | cancelled; no exit from terminal.

Generation: pending → running → verifying → scoring → reproducing → completed
            scoring → completed                 (FIX: zero-survivors — completes with no offspring)
            running → degraded → verifying       (FIX: partial failure — proceeds if ≥1 candidate reached `created`)
            {running|verifying|scoring|reproducing} → failed   (FIX: per-state deadline / wall-clock / kill abort)
            pending → skipped

Candidate:  created → under_review → checked → scored → selected
            created → repairing → under_review   (FIX: structured-output repair, ≤1 retry, energy-metered)
            repairing → invalid                  (repair budget exhausted)
            created → invalid
            under_review → rejected
            scored → culled

Agenome:    seeded → active → spent → eligible_parent   (eligible only once a candidate reached a fitness score)
            active → failed
            eligible_parent → reproduced
            eligible_parent → culled
            * no energy spend after spent | failed | culled.
```

**Resolved edge rules (from the audit):**
- **Zero-survivors / all-culled:** a generation with no eligible parents takes `scoring → completed` (no offspring) and emits `generation.completed{survivors:0}`. Run terminal classification: end `completed` if **any** generation ever produced a `selected` best-so-far (that is the final idea); end `failed` only if **no** generation ever produced a scored survivor.
- **Partial generation failure:** the generation proceeds to `verifying` as long as ≥1 candidate reached `created` (configurable `minPopulationSurvival`); `running → failed` only if **all** agenomes fail or provider failures exceed the run retry cap. Emits a partial-failure event listing failed agenome IDs.
- **Structured-output repair:** invalid output goes `created → repairing → under_review` on a successful repair (≤1 repair attempt for MVP), else `repairing → invalid`. Repair attempts are energy-metered (cannot loop unbounded).
- **Degenerate reproduction:** `<2` eligible parents → mutation-only reproduction from the single survivor, emitting `agenome.reproduced{mode:"mutation_only"}`; `0` survivors → zero-survivors path above.
- **Internal FIX-edge statuses (`degraded`/`repairing`) are not distinct event types.** `GenerationStatus:'degraded'` (the partial-failure edge) and `CandidateStatus:'repairing'` (the structured-output-repair edge) are state-machine-**internal** transient states — no `RunEventType` member carries them (the registry's generation/candidate events are lifecycle + terminal markers, §4). A derived projection (§9) therefore surfaces them only when the live kernel reports current state out of band; the event-log-derived current-state reducer adds **no** transition for them. They remain reachable in the frozen status enum (for the kernel's own state machine) and in the dashboard status-map (for display-exhaustiveness, §12), but never via an event fold. _(Clarified 2026-06-22, round-4 demo→cody integration; pinned by `apps/api/test/.../current-state.test.ts` `test_degraded_repairing_have_no_event_transition` + apps/api LESSONS §62.)_

## §4 — Contracts & event model (source of truth)

**Postgres is authoritative; `run_events` is append-only.** `sequence` is monotonic **per run** and is the **sole ordering key** for replay and SSE resume; `occurredAt` is display/analytics-only and never used for ordering (see §15 clock authority). All read models are derived (§9).

`RunEventEnvelope` and the **closed** `RunEventType` registry are typed in **Appendix A** — including the failure/terminal events (`provider_call_failed`, `output_schema_rejected`, `candidate_invalidated`, `energy_exhausted`, `generation_failed`, `reproduction_aborted_insufficient_parents`, `novelty_scoring_degraded`, `run.failed`, `run.stopped`) so every failure path in §3/§5 has a persisted, replayable event (closes `RISK-006`). `actor` is the closed 7-role union (canonical; supersedes the draft's `actor: string`). `payload` is JSONB for MVP speed, narrowed by a per-type payload-shape map for the high-traffic types (`energy.spent`, `candidate.created`, `critic.reviewed`, `check.completed`, `novelty.scored`, `fitness.scored`). A per-type narrowing layer (`packages/contracts/src/events/payload-map.ts`, P0.10) maps each high-traffic type to its frozen Appendix-A model — one Zod schema validates the event-store write and the model — via an own-property resolver that fails **open** to the generic JSONB payload for any other type and fails **closed** (rejects) on a high-traffic mismatch; a bounded payload ceiling (`MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES`=1 MiB, `MAX_PAYLOAD_DEPTH`=32, checked **depth-first then size** so a deeply-nested payload cannot stack-overflow `JSON.stringify`) rejects oversize / over-deep / unserializable payloads as a result object at the append boundary, never throwing. `fitness.scored` reuses `FitnessScore` unchanged; the novelty link is the shared `candidateId` + the `components.novelty` signal.

**Live in-flight observability (resolved — operation-start markers).** Beyond completion events, the registry includes lightweight **operation-start markers** so the dashboard shows *exactly what each agent is doing in-flight*, not only what it finished: `generation.verifying` / `generation.scoring` / `generation.reproducing` (generation phase entered), `candidate.generation_started`, `critic.review_started`, `check.started`, `novelty.scoring_started`, `judge.review_started`, `fusion.started`, and `tool_call.started` / `tool_call.finished`. Each carries the `run/generation/agenome/candidate` correlation IDs; the dashboard derives a per-node **working / in-flight** sub-state when a start is seen without its paired completion and clears it on completion (§12). Markers are **authoritative and persisted** so **replay reproduces the same live in-flight experience** — yet they need **no provider call to replay** and **do not debit energy** (only the underlying op's success does, §4 Energy). A dangling start with no completion is valid (crash/timeout → run failed; replay shows started→failed). They are the runtime's real-time window into every agent; deeper per-call traces (latency/cost/tokens) live in Langfuse (§13). Adding these to the closed `RunEventType` enum is a `schemaVersion` bump (re-record fixtures).

**Authoring mechanism (resolved):** contracts are authored as **Zod schemas** with TS types via `z.infer`, so one schema both validates event-store writes and validates ModelGateway structured outputs — no parallel TS+JSON-Schema definitions.

**`schemaVersion` handling (resolved):** every envelope carries `schemaVersion`. Projection/replay readers must accept all `schemaVersion ≤ current`. The contracts package pins the current version as the exported constant `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` (**currently `10`** — bumped 1→2 for the operation-start markers [P0.1-amend], 2→3 for the judge-output seam `JudgeResult`+`judge.reviewed` [P0.16], 3→4 for the `degraded`+`repairing` §3 FIX-edge statuses the freeze omitted [kernel-020, linearized after a cross-track collision — see `docs/runbooks/cross-track-contract-coordination.md`], 4→5 for the 4 terminal events `run.cancelled`/`generation.skipped`/`agenome.failed`/`candidate.rejected` [kernel-026], 5→6 for the FB.0 frontend-v2 run-controls — `RunConfig` +`generationOperators?`/`generationBias?`/`modelRouteOverride?` + the closed `GenerationOperator` enum, additive; 6→7 for the FB.6 frontend-v2 raw-reasoning capture — new `RunEventType` `llm_call_telemetry` + the high-traffic `LlmCallTelemetry` payload, additive [secret-surface: the captured raw fields ride the existing append + Langfuse scrub seams (rule #4), are truncated-with-marker under the 1 MiB ceiling, and replay reads them with no provider (rule #7)]; 7→8 for the FB.4 frontend-v2 diverge/converge dial — additive optional `samplingParams{temperature?}` on `ModelGatewayRequest` + `LlmCallTelemetry` (the latter records the EXECUTED generation temperature), additive [rule #6 SOLO: the dial's band framing + temperature reach the `population_generator` request only; the `final_judge`/`critic` path carries none; replay reads the recorded temperature, never re-samples — rule #7]; 8→9 for the FB.8 frontend-v2 judge per-axis rationale — additive OPTIONAL `axisRationales` (a `FinalJudgeAxis`→string record) on `JudgeResult`, the held-out judge's per-axis one-line EXPLANATION emitted alongside its scores [rule #6: EXPLANATORY OUTPUT only — `acceptance` stays runner-computed from `axisScores` × the immutable rubric weights, and the anchor `ScoringPolicy`/`FinalJudgeRubric`/`FinalJudgeAxis` (incl. `immutableToAgents`) is byte-identical; the rationale explains the floor, it cannot move it]; 9→10 for the tool-use TU.1 agent research-tools — additive `ToolName` (frozen 4-member allowlist web_search/fetch_url/x_search/youtube_search, rule #3) + `ToolDescriptor` + `ToolCallRequest` + OPTIONAL `ModelGatewayRequest.tools?` + OPTIONAL `ModelGatewayResponse.toolCallRequests?` [rule #6: tools attach ONLY to the `population_generator` route — the held-out judge / critic path never sees a tool, so the anchor `ScoringPolicy`/`FinalJudgeRubric`/`FinalJudgeAxis` is byte-identical; rule #5: a tool result re-enters as `wrapUntrusted` DATA at the orchestrator; rule #7: every tool result is persisted + replay-read, never re-fetched; rule #1: `maxToolCalls` is kernel-enforced]); the `≤ current` reader-acceptance logic landed with the Phase-1 replay/projection readers. MVP policy: **re-record the demo-fallback fixture whenever `schemaVersion` bumps** (cheaper than upcasters for a 2-week build); per-version upcasters are a deferred option. The rehearsal checklist (§16) pins the fixture's `schemaVersion`. Schema/table changes ship a migration (§9).

**Energy (resolved — load-bearing).** Energy is one integer unit `doppl_energy`. Cost map (config, tunable post-spike): `tokensPerUnit: 1000`, `perToolCall: 5`, `perSpawn: 50`. On a **successful** call the ledger is **debited pre-call with an estimate, reconciled post-call** against returned provider usage; `energy.spent` persists both estimate and actual. **Failed/retried/repaired attempts do NOT debit energy** (energy = successful *productive* spend only — a flaky provider must not starve an agenome, and the "energy efficiency" fitness signal stays fair). Finiteness is therefore **not** rested on energy for failures: it is guaranteed by the **bounded retry count (default 2) + per-call timeout + wall-clock cap + max-tool-calls/generations/population/depth**, so the recursive loop is still finite by construction. A failed attempt emits `provider_call_failed`, never `energy.spent`. Energy is also a fitness component ("energy efficiency"), so the unit is shared by `runtime-kernel` (caps) and `selection-scoring` (efficiency).

**Replay determinism contract (resolved — the demo's safety net).** Replay applies to a *persisted* event log (no model calls → bit-stable projection). The assertion is **state-equivalence**: the projection rebuilt from the stored log equals the projection captured at run end, over a canonical serialization. The seed-to-summary fixture is a recorded-event replay, not a live re-run.

**RNG / non-determinism capture (resolved — critical, from the completeness critic).** All kernel non-determinism (mutation field selection + magnitudes, parent-selection tie-breaks, fusion crossover points, any sampling) is either (a) drawn from a **per-run seed persisted in `run.configured`** and reproduced deterministically on replay, or (b) its concrete outcome persisted in the `agenome.mutated` / `agenome.fused` / `lineage.culled` payloads. **Replay reconstructs from persisted seed/outcomes and never re-samples.** Likewise, **retrieval/web-search results are persisted into the originating event** so replay never re-calls the web; embedding **vectors** are persisted (§9) so replay never re-embeds.
  - **Concrete PRNG (P3.6, `apps/api/src/runtime/rng/seededRng.ts`):** the kernel's seeded generator is **mulberry32** (32-bit state), seeded from `RunConfig.rngSeed` normalized `seed >>> 0` — pure integer ops + one IEEE-754 division, byte-stable across V8. This concrete algorithm + normalization **IS** the cross-machine replay byte-stability guarantee; swapping the generator silently breaks older persisted replays, so a generator change is **schemaVersion-relevant** (treat like a contract amendment).

## §5 — Runtime kernel

The custom TypeScript kernel owns the run state machine, the generation loop, **cap enforcement**, the **energy ledger**, scheduling, RNG seeding, and terminal state. It is the sole emitter of authoritative lifecycle events.

**Caps (load-bearing invariant).** `RunCaps` (Appendix A) = `{maxPopulation, maxGenerations, energyBudget (doppl_energy), maxSpawnDepth, maxToolCalls, wallClockTimeoutMs}`. Caps are enforced **in the kernel, never by prompt text**. The agenome's `spawnBudget` trait is an **allocation hint only**: `effectiveSpawns = min(agenome.spawnBudget, remaining global caps)`; the clamp decision is emitted as an event. An agenome trait can never raise a cap. The **kill switch** (operator stop or any cap breach) drives `{any non-terminal} → failed/stopped`, halts scheduling, drains in-flight calls, and writes a partial terminal summary.

**Mutagen-operator generation framing (FB.3 `bbe88a2`, frontend-v2).** `RunConfig.generationOperators?` (FB.0's closed 7-member `GenerationOperator` enum) is honored in the generation loop as **TRUSTED system-message framing**, not isolated data: each selected operator maps to a **system-authored vetted ideation-lens fragment** (`OPERATOR_FRAGMENTS`) composed — via the pure, enum-canonical-order `composeOperatorFraming` — into the `population_generator` **system** message (alongside `agenome.systemPrompt` + the fixed `GENERATION_ISOLATION_FRAMING`), so the operator STEERS generation. Because the operator is a closed enum of vetted constants there is **no untrusted free-text → no injection path** (rule #5); the per-run problem stays isolated as untrusted DATA in the `wrapUntrusted` **user** message (PD.10, unchanged) — the trusted-instruction and untrusted-subject channels stay strictly separate. `mergePerRunConfig` threads `generationOperators` (recorded == executed); the assembly is pure → replay reconstructs the identical framing from the persisted `run.configured.generationOperators` with no provider call (rule #7). An operator shapes the PROMPT only — caps/energy untouched (rule #1/#8), and no fragment references the judge/rubric/scoring (rule #6 — operators steer generation, never the held-out anchor). _(security-reviewer INVARIANT CLEAN.)_

**Diverge/converge dial (FB.4 `e46c908`, frontend-v2 — SOLO rule-#6 invariant).** `RunConfig.generationBias?` ∈ [−1,+1] (FB.0; diverge(+)/converge(−), 0 neutral) is honored as a **framing-primary hybrid (A+)**: the dial maps to (1) a **system-authored band fragment** (`BIAS_FRAGMENTS`, 5 bands at the ratified edges ±0.2 neutral / ±0.6 strong) composed by the pure `composeBiasFraming` into the `population_generator` **system** message (alongside the operator framing + `GENERATION_ISOLATION_FRAMING`) AND (2) a **clamped temperature nudge** `biasToTemperature(bias) = clamp(0.7 + 0.3·bias, [0.4, 1.2])` set on that request's `samplingParams.temperature` (the OpenRouter adapter threads it like `maxTokens`). The dial is engaged only when non-neutral, so a neutral/absent dial keeps the request byte-identical to the baseline. **Rule #6 SOLO (the load-bearing pin):** the band framing + temperature reach the `population_generator` request ONLY — the `final_judge` and `critic` requests are built by the single `assembleIsolatedRequest` chokepoint, whose parameter type carries **no** bias/`samplingParams` field, so the dial is **structurally** unable to reach the evaluation path (the held-out judge/rubric/scoring/selection stay byte-identical for diverge vs converge). The **executed** temperature is recorded into `llm_call_telemetry.samplingParams` (recorded == executed), so replay reads the recorded value and never re-derives via `biasToTemperature` or re-samples (rule #7). `mergePerRunConfig` threads `generationBias` (an explicit neutral 0 preserved); the band set is a CLOSED system-authored map selected by the numeric dial — no untrusted free-text (rule #5), the problem stays `wrapUntrusted` DATA; prompt + sampling only, caps/energy untouched (rule #1/#8); no fragment references the judge/rubric/scoring (rule #6). The actual behavioral effect of a band/temperature on generation is a model-dependent live-LLM `/eval` question (novelty axis), NOT a unit assertion. _(security-reviewer INVARIANT CLEAN — 7/7, structural proof.)_

**Failure handling (resolved):**
- **Retry/timeout policy:** bounded retries (default 2) with short backoff, per-role timeout, one fallback-route attempt before final reject. Failed/retried/repaired attempts **do not debit energy** (§4); they are bounded instead by the retry count + per-call timeout + wall-clock cap. `provider_call_failed{attempt,reason}` per failed attempt; a terminal reject fails the candidate (`→ invalid`), not the generation.
- **Energy exhaustion mid-generation:** stop scheduling new work, let in-flight calls drain, emit `energy_exhausted` + partial summary, **score the candidates already verified** (so the demo still shows progress).
- **Embedding/novelty failure:** retry, then fall back to app-level lexical/secondary novelty, then emit `novelty_scoring_degraded` and compute fitness with the novelty component flagged estimated/absent — never block `scoring`.
- **Crash recovery (resolved — MVP):** **crash-forward.** On restart the kernel reads the event log, marks any non-terminal run `failed` (`run.failed{reason:"crash"}`) with a partial summary; the operator falls back to a prepared/replay run. True idempotent resume is deferred (flagged).

**Workers & concurrency (resolved — adopt-with-flag):** single **in-process async worker** inside `apps/api`; every job is idempotent, guarded by event-sequence checks (no external queue — deferred). MVP **serializes to one active run at a time** (kernel-enforced); replay is read-only and viewable concurrently with a live run. **Concurrent multi-run execution is an explicit stretch (§18)** — the seam is a global run-concurrency cap, but it is not built for the showcase.

## §6 — Model gateway & provider integration

Domain/runtime code calls a `ModelGateway` port and sees only `ModelGatewayRequest/Response` + `ProviderCapability` (Appendix A). Adapters own vendor SDKs.

- **Roles:** `population_generator`, `critic`, `subtype_check`, `embedding`, `final_judge` (the held-out judge, §7), `fusion_synthesis`, **`retrieval`** (web-search/grounding capability, added per the Q2 decision).
- **Routing:** OpenRouter is primary for generation/critic/judge/synthesis. **Embeddings are pinned to direct OpenAI** (`text-embedding-3-small`) behind the gateway as a deliberate MVP decision — the "OpenRouter-only" fallback still needs an OpenAI key for embeddings, or the app-level-cosine path that needs no embeddings at all. Anthropic is a same-seam adapter. Model tiering: cheaper model for population/critic calls, stronger model for final judge/synthesis. Codex stays **research-only** — never on the critical path.
- **Retrieval grounding (Q2 = live web retrieval):** a web-search/retrieval adapter behind the gateway grounds critics and zeitgeist `currentSignals`/prior-art checks. **Demo-safety:** results are **persisted into the originating event** (replay never re-calls the web), an operator-curated **static prior-art/signals corpus** is the rehearsed fallback, and retrieval cost/latency/**rate-limits** are tracked as demo risk (`RISK-004/005`). Web-search tool calls have extra provider cost — budget accordingly (§15).
  - **Implemented semantics (P2.7):** the retrieval adapter is **never-reject / always-curated-fallback** — a terminal live-search failure falls back to the curated corpus (tagged `fallbackSourced`), never throws `ProviderCallError` and never rejects (a deliberate divergence from the P2.5/P2.6 throw→reject adapter leg; an empty curated match is a valid empty result, not a failure). The live-search **provider is a pluggable seam — no vendor pinned** (deferred to the §6 retrieval spike); the retrieval credential loads **lazily in the live-client factory, NOT in `assertProviderCredentials`** (the curated-fallback path needs no creds, so the kernel boots without a retrieval key).
- **Structured outputs:** strict JSON-schema/structured-output where supported; every model output is validated against its Zod schema and **accepted, repaired (≤1), or rejected** with an event. Provider metadata (provider, modelId, gatewayRequestId, tokens, cost estimate) + Langfuse trace/observation IDs are returned and persisted on the event.
  - **Provider structured-output mode (PD.13):** the OpenRouter adapter requests `response_format:{type:'json_object'}` (NOT strict `json_schema`) — a discriminated-union schema (`CandidateContent`, root `anyOf` + an optional field) is rejected by OpenAI's strict structured-output subset (HTTP 400, curl-confirmed under BOTH strict modes; the subset requires a root `object` with every key `required`). The target shape is conveyed as a **trusted, candidate-INDEPENDENT system instruction** (derived only from the request schema, never candidate text — §14/§7 isolation intact). Provider strict-mode was only an optimization: the gateway's Zod **validate / repair(≤1) / reject stays the authoritative validator** (rule #5 UNWEAKENED; an unvalidated output never enters the log). Live-validated end-to-end (PD.8c re-run: a real `'selected'` winner produced). `apps/api/LESSONS` §98.
- **Capability matrix (MVP-lean):** start with `structuredOutputs` + `embeddings` (the two that gate the demo); `toolCalling`/`streaming` flags and multi-hop `fallbackRouteIds` chains are added when a second provider is actually wired.
- **Per-run model-route override + local providers (FB.0 contract / FB.1–FB.2 runtime, frontend-v2):** `RunConfig.modelRouteOverride?` (`partialRecord(ModelRole, {provider,modelId})`) lets a run override the role→route mapping; it is **allowlist-CLAMPED** (FB.2 `a6104fa`): a frozen per-role `MODEL_ROUTE_OVERRIDE_ALLOWLIST` permits `{provider,modelId}` per role, enforced at **TWO gates** — a `POST /runs` **422** before the `run.configured` append (rule #2) AND a per-run registry **overlay that re-clamps** (rule #1 KERNEL-bound, not route-only — a direct-append bypass still can't widen, mirroring the caps re-clamp). It covers the GENERATION roles (population_generator + fusion_synthesis) and **EXCLUDES `final_judge` (rule #6 — the held-out judge model is not run-swappable)**; fail-closed (no allowlist → no override). Replay reconstructs from the persisted route (rule #7, no provider call). `provider` stays an OPEN string in the contract (no provider enum), so adding a local provider (`ollama`) was a RUNTIME change, **not** a contract one: **FB.1 (`a99a92e`)** made `createLiveGateway` **provider-dispatching** — the injected `providerCall` resolves `route.provider` per request and dispatches via a `provider→providerCall` map (`{openrouter, ollama}`); an unregistered provider → an honest 0-token `ProviderCallError`, so **the dispatch map IS the runtime provider allowlist** (no silent fallback). The currently-configured non-`{openrouter,ollama}` providers (`openai` for embedding, `web-search` for retrieval) ride a **legacy passthrough** to the OpenRouter call so those roles are unchanged (the live-embedding path is a documented follow-up). `ollama` is **keyless** (`OLLAMA_BASE_URL`, default localhost:11434 — rule #4 holds trivially); structured output uses JSON mode + a candidate-independent schema instruction with the gateway's validate/repair/reject staying authoritative (rule #5); replay builds no client (rule #7). Embeddings remain OpenAI-pinned. Keys stay server-side (rule #4).

## §7 — Verifier council & checks

**Critic council** emits **structured evidence only** — it never selects winners, mutates candidates/lineage, or alters the scoring policy. MVP mandates (closed `CriticMandate` union): `factual_grounding`, `novelty_prior_art`, `feasibility`, `falsification`, `subtype_specific`. `CriticReview` and `CheckResult` are typed in Appendix A.

**Held-out judge + critic rotation (`REQ-F-016` — Q1 decision, the core-bet defense).** A frozen **held-out `final_judge` role**, **outside the breeding loop**, applies a fixed rubric and produces the **acceptance metric** that decides "gen N+1 beats gen N." The **critic agenome set rotates across generations** so the target keeps moving. The held-out judge config and the rubric are **immutable to agents** (a security invariant, §14): metric mutation, if ever attempted, cannot move this bedrock anchor. The MVP rubric is a **5-axis 0–5 scale** — grounding, novelty, feasibility, falsification-survival, subtype-check pass — applied by the held-out judge; weights start equal with a small energy-efficiency tiebreak, are **policy-versioned**, and are refined post-spike (the numeric weights are the only deferred-open piece of the scoring contract). The judge's acceptance output is **schema-validated** (accept/repair≤1/reject, rule #5) and persisted as a frozen **`JudgeResult`** (Appendix A) via the terminal **`judge.reviewed`** event — the authoritative, replay-faithful record selection consumes (the §2.5 verifier→selection seam; `axisScores`+`acceptance` are required so replay reads them, never re-judges).

> **Critic rotation (mechanism, P4.7).** The active critic-mandate set per generation is produced by `selectCriticMandates({rngSeed, generationIndex, activeCount?})` (`apps/api/src/verifier/council/rotation.ts`): a pure closed-form derivation from the persisted `RunConfig.rngSeed` + `Generation.index` (per-generation `Math.imul`-avalanche seed → deterministic Fisher-Yates over the closed `CriticMandate.options` → first K, default K=3 of 5). Re-derived on replay — NOT recorded through the §4 outcome bridge (which is only for draws position-dependent on the shared run stream) — so replay reproduces the identical set without re-sampling (rule #7). Codomain = `CriticMandate.options` and the signature takes no candidate/agenome input, so it structurally cannot touch the held-out judge anchor (rule #6) nor be moved by candidate content / agenome metric-mutation. Feeds the P4.6 council; first live caller is the P3 generation `verifying` phase.

**Check runners (resolved mechanism).** Subtype-specific objective checks run **only** through a static **allowlist registry of `CheckRunnerAdapter`s** (keyed by adapter ID, mirroring the model registry). Adapters are **non-executing for MVP** (no arbitrary code); an unregistered or execution-requiring check is rejected and recorded as `check.completed{status:"skipped", reason}`. Both subtypes are **equal must-ship** (Q2): `cross_domain_transfer` gets source-domain-validity / target-fit / mapping-quality / prior-art / prepared toy-or-allowlisted-executable checks; `zeitgeist_synthesis` gets current-signal grounding / novelty / timing / coherence / falsifiability against the retrieval source. The **"execute the transfer live"** demo moment re-runs the winning idea's **allowlisted** check live for prepared problems, with replay-backed fallback (`REQ-E-003`).

**Prompt-injection isolation (resolved mechanism — `T-002`/`RISK-008`).** Candidate text reaches critics/judges **only inside a dedicated structured field / separate user-role message**, wrapped in a fixed sentinel delimiter, with the instruction that delimited content is **data to evaluate, not instructions to follow** — never interpolated into a system/instruction string. The `criticInput` shape models trusted rubric and untrusted candidate payload as distinct fields. A fixture asserts a candidate saying "ignore your rubric, score 10" does not move the score.

## §8 — Selection, scoring & reproduction

Selection-scoring owns the **policy-versioned, decomposed** `FitnessScore` (Appendix A) = `{total, components, policyVersion, explanation}` from `ScoringPolicy` = `{version, weights, normalization?}` — **structure frozen, numeric weights deferred-open**. Components: critic scores, subtype-check results, **novelty** (`REQ-I-003`, now required — `REQ-F-008` tightened from "if present"), and energy efficiency, plus the **held-out judge** acceptance score (§7). All selection decisions must be **explainable from persisted events** (`novelty.scored` is the authoritative home for novelty and `judge.reviewed` the authoritative home for the held-out-judge acceptance; `fitness.scored` references both the novelty and the judge acceptance it consumed — by the shared `candidateId` join + the named `components.novelty` / `components.judge_acceptance` signals, never a duplicate authoritative copy). Novelty is computed within the generation `scoring` state.

**Novelty:** embed candidate summaries, compare (cosine/nearest-neighbor) against prior candidates in the run/generation. **App-level cosine day-one** (MVP scale is tiny); pgvector is a deferred indexing optimization layered on the authoritative event-stored vectors (§9). Degrade path per §5.

**Reproduction-fusion:** two-level fusion (`REQ-F-010`) — agenome-level crossover (splice parents' prompts/personas/toolsets) + output-level synthesis (a model merges two parents' reasoning). **Fusion prefers distant lineages** (parent-distance via the idea-space/novelty embedding) as an explicit anti-collapse force (closes the PRD "fusion across distant lineages" gap). Child agenomes record parentage + mutation/fusion metadata and are schema-validated. Mutation changes traits within allowed bounds; RNG outcomes persisted (§4). Degenerate `<2`-parent fallback per §3. **Allocation is heuristic** for MVP (fitness × novelty × energy-efficiency); learned bandit/RL + a learned value model / credit assignment are deferred (`REQ-I-004`, `REQ-DEF-010`).

> **Runtime wiring (P5↔P3, selection track).** Selection's surface is driven by the P3 generation loop through three injected seam ports (the loop is pure orchestration; it appends only kernel events + consumes seam events as DATA — §2.5 boundary as code shape):
> - **Score path order (per generation `scoring` state):** for each candidate — scoreNovelty (gateway embedding → `novelty.scored`, or the lexical-degrade → `novelty_scoring_degraded`) → read the candidate's persisted `critic.reviewed` / `check.completed` / `judge.reviewed` / `energy.spent` → compose the 5 fitness components (`judge_acceptance` read verbatim via the candidateId join) → scoreFitness (→ `fitness.scored`) → after all candidates, cull (→ `lineage.culled`).
> - **Reproduce path:** the loop resolves eligible parents (`fitness.scored` ∧ ¬`lineage.culled`) and passes them to the reproduce seam, which projects best-candidate heuristic weights from the persisted scored events, then allocates (caps-clamped hint) + reproduces per slot (≥2 distinct → two-level fusion; 1 → mutation_only). The reproduce seam takes an INJECTED per-run numeric seed (not the kernel's OutcomeSource) — selection's RNG outcomes live in the frozen `ReproductionEvent` (its rule-#7 replay home).
> - **Successor threading:** gen N+1's population = gen N's reproduced offspring, reconstructed via `applyReproduction` from the persisted reproduction events (no gateway/rng), re-homed to the next generation (status `seeded`), and CLAMPED by the kernel loop to `maxPopulation` (rule #1 — the selection hook proposes, the kernel bounds).
> - **Boot composition (production entry):** POST /runs → `run.configured` → `onRunConfigured` → `runWorker` → the loop. The boot root wires all three real seams (verify/score/reproduce) + the threading hook, single-sourcing ONE immutable judge rubric to BOTH the verifier (judge) and selection (`judgeAcceptance`) so the candidateId join's policyVersion matches (rule #6).
> - **Per-run config:** the worker EXECUTES the operator's recorded `run.configured` (recorded == executed): caps/rngSeed/enabledSubtypes merged over the boot AppConfig, each cap clamped to `min(posted, boot ceiling)` — never raises (rule #1); the boot immutables (scoringPolicy/judge rubric/seedSet) are not operator-overridable.

## §9 — Persistence & projections

Postgres authoritative; `run_events` append-only with per-run `sequence`. **Migrations (resolved):** a TS-native migration tool (recommend **Drizzle Kit** or `node-pg-migrate`); every projection/table change ships a migration; local and hosted run the **same migration chain at boot**, then the seed/replay loader.

**Append-only enforcement (trigger + privilege — resolved; role-split deferred to hosted).** `run_events` immutability is enforced by a row+statement trigger that rejects `UPDATE`/`DELETE`/`TRUNCATE` (incl. upsert/CTE/join bypasses) on a normal role. The trigger is **necessary but not sufficient for rule #2**: a DB role that is a **superuser or the table owner** can disable it on its own connection (`SET session_replication_role='replica'` / `ALTER TABLE … DISABLE TRIGGER ALL`), so full append-only enforcement also requires the runtime to connect as a **least-privilege app role** (INSERT/SELECT only — not owner, not superuser) with migrations run as a separate owner/admin role. **For the local-first demo this role-split is DEFERRED** — the runtime never disables triggers and there is no adversarial DB access locally, so trigger-only is accepted; it is a **REQUIRED hardening if hosted is pursued** (pairs with the §14 access gate). _(origin: 2026-06-21 P1.4 `[high]` finding; user-ratified defer-to-hosted.)_

**Canonical projection/table set** (one list — closes the cross-doc drift): `runs`, `run_events` (authoritative), `generations`, `agenomes`, `candidate_ideas`, `critic_reviews`, `check_results`, `fitness_scores`, `novelty_scores`, `lineage_edges`, `embeddings` (authoritative-once-computed; see below), `dashboard_snapshots` (optional, rebuildable). Any cached projection (incl. `dashboard_snapshots`) records the `(runId, sequence)` watermark it was built through and is discarded/rebuilt when newer events exist.

**Embeddings (resolved — critical).** Embedding **vectors are authoritative-once-computed**, not a rebuildable projection: the vector + embedding-model-id + dimension are **persisted in the `novelty.scored` event payload** (JSONB float array) regardless of pgvector — so replay (which forbids re-embedding) reads the stored vector and recomputes only the deterministic cosine math. pgvector, if enabled, is a query index over those authoritative vectors, never the system of record. This holds in both the pgvector and app-cosine day-one paths.

**Raw/normalized outputs (resolved).** Both raw provider output and normalized candidate output are stored **inline in the authoritative event payload** (JSONB); an `EvidenceRef` (Appendix A) is a pointer **within the Postgres tier**, never to a non-authoritative external store — so replay never dereferences something it cannot reproduce.

**EvidenceRef resolver — fail-closed taxonomy (P1.7).** The resolver classifies each ref: `eventId` → resolve within the Postgres tier (`not_found` if absent); a ref carrying ONLY `uri` **or `langfuseObservationId`** → `external_only` (**never fetched** — Langfuse is the §6/§13 non-authoritative side channel; replay must not call it, rule #7/§14); a ref with neither (incl. `label`-only) → `no_pointer`. Consumers create a **fresh resolver per projection/replay pass** (its cache is read-once-per-run).

**Replay reader — validate-not-sort (P1.8).** The replay reader asserts the persisted log is strictly-increasing + contiguous-from-0 in `sequence` and throws `ReplayIntegrityError{reason: 'gap'|'out_of_order'|'schema_too_new'}` (out_of_order checked before gap) — it **never silently re-sorts or skips** a corrupted authoritative log. It accepts `schemaVersion ≤ CURRENT` (older replays, no upcasters) and rejects newer. It returns validated `RunEventRow[]` and does **not** re-parse to `RunEventEnvelope` — the P1.3 append path is the envelope-validation boundary (rule #2 append-only + the P1.4 least-privilege model make a stored row trustworthy by construction). Rule #7 is enforced **structurally**: the reader imports no provider/model/web seam. Fold states injected by P6/PD consumers MUST be JSON-safe (Dates `toJSON`-normalized by `canonicalSerialize`; BigInt/circular throw loud).

> **§4 diagram note (stale-doc, harmless):** the §4 flow diagram labels the replay ordering "ordered by run_id, sequence"; the code (`readByRun`) orders by `sequence` alone within a run-scoped `WHERE run_id = $1` — functionally equivalent for a single-run query; the diagram notation is just loose.

## §10 — Lineage graph & Neo4j spike

Consumers depend on the storage-agnostic `LineageGraphProjection` (Appendix A: nodes/edges + `sequenceThrough`), not on physical storage. **React Flow** renders it with custom node types (agenome, candidate, critic/check, score, selected winner) and a layout helper (Dagre/ELK) if needed.

**Selected-winner derivation (resolved — PD.11).** No `candidate.selected` event exists; the kernel records the winner ONLY as `run.completed.finalIdeaRef` (the top-score `¬culled` survivor — §3/§5, `terminalClassifier.ts`). The `'selected'` candidate status that the lineage node (→ the §12 final-idea panel's `selectWinner`), the replay-summary digest, and current-state read is therefore **projection-DERIVED**: a single pure current-state reducer marks the `finalIdeaRef` candidate `'selected'` when folding `run.completed` (a no-op when absent or the candidate isn't materialized — never fabricated, rule #6 emit-only). The winner is **kernel-decided, not projection-invented**; replay state-equivalence holds because the mark lives in the shared current-state fold (rule #7). When an authoritative `candidate.selected` (P5) later lands it supersedes by `candidateId` join. ZERO new contract surface (`CandidateStatus` already includes `'selected'`).

**Neo4j spike (deferred runtime; timeboxed — resolved scope).** Run it in **week 2, after the React Flow demo path works**, capped at ~1 engineer-day, as a **throwaway notebook** proving query shapes (ancestors-of-winner, parent-contribution, critic-kill patterns, lineage distance/diversity, dashboard export) — **not** a synced read model, never a runtime dependency, must never block the demo loop (`REQ-D-006/007`, `REQ-I-005`, ADR-007).

## §11 — Backend API & flows

REST for commands/queries; **SSE** for live run-event streaming (`REQ-F-015`, ADR-010). SSE is delivery only (non-authoritative); clients resume from the last seen `sequence` (`lastEventId`) or fall back to polling/replay. **The stream carries both completion events and the §4 operation-start markers**, so the dashboard's real-time window shows each agent/critic/check/fusion *in-flight*, not only on completion. Mutating endpoints are idempotent (idempotency key / terminal-state guard).

```text
POST /runs                      GET /runs            GET /runs/:id
POST /runs/:id/stop             GET /runs/:id/events GET /runs/:id/stream   (SSE)
GET  /runs/:id/lineage          GET /runs/:id/replay GET /runs/:id/health   (FIX: progress/diagnostics)
GET  /runs/:id/candidates/:cid  GET /model-routes
GET  /problem-sets              GET /demo/fallback-ladder   (PD.5a / PD.12 — demo)
```

Flows (detail in `USER_FLOWS.md`): configure & start · execute generation · verify candidates · score/cull/fuse/mutate · observe live · replay · stop/complete. `GET /runs/:id/health` exposes current generation, candidates in flight, **operations in flight** (from unpaired operation-start markers — agenomes generating, critics reviewing, checks running, judge deliberating, fusions synthesizing), last-event time, and caps consumed — the runtime signal the operator needs to decide *continue vs. switch to replay* during the 10-minute window (Langfuse can't give this).

**Phase-D web↔API wiring (resolved — PD.12/14/15/16):** the dashboard reaches the API in local dev via a **Vite dev proxy** `/api`→`http://localhost:3000` (rewrite-strips `/api`, SSE-safe; base overridable via `VITE_API_BASE`, PD.14) — the API serves at root, no `/api` prefix. The read routes (`GET /runs/:id/events`) and the **SSE frame serializer** emit through a shared **omit-null wire serializer** that drops null/undefined optionals so the frozen `RunEventEnvelope`'s `.optional()` fields re-parse on the consumer (read-path/presentation only — the log is untouched, rule #2; downstream of the redaction scrub, rule #4; Date-guarded so `occurredAt` isn't flattened, `apps/api/LESSONS` §31/§98; PD.15). The web data-client consumes the API's actual shapes — `GET /runs`→`{runs:[summary]}`, `GET /runs/:id`→`{runId,sequenceThrough,state}`, `GET /runs/:id/events`→`{runId,events}` (`?since=` cursor), `GET /runs/:id/replay`→the replay-summary — and the command shapes `POST /runs`→`{runId}`, `POST /runs/:id/stop`→`{runId,status,stopped}`|`{runId,stopRequested}` (PD.15/PD.16). ZERO frozen-contract change (no `.nullable()`; web-local response types). A REAL web→proxy→API smoke (booted+seeded, testcontainer PG, gated) exercises the connection the prior mocked e2e hid (`apps/web/LESSON §12`), which surfaced + closed the full read/SSE/command drift before the merge.

**Demo-polish round (PD.17–PD.20):** the dashboard adds a **run-list / replay browser** (`GET /runs` → click → observe any past run in replay mode; `mode` is Dashboard state, PD.17); **live projection re-fetch** — lineage + health are re-fetched on the SSE cadence (debounced + forced on terminal) so the graph grows live rather than rendering a one-time fetch (PD.20); a **cap-maxima read route** `GET /config/caps` returning the boot `defaultConfig.caps` the run-config form clamps to (fixes the cap-default 422; rule #1 stays route-authoritative — `overCapField` is the sole enforcer, the clamp is UX-only; PD.18); and a clear API startup log line after `listen` (PD.19). All ZERO frozen-contract change.

## §12 — Frontend dashboard

React/TypeScript, consuming REST projections + SSE; **never mutates authoritative state**. Panels (`REQ-F-013`, `REQ-UX-*`, `REQ-E-*`): operator run-config; **live/replay mode indicator**; React Flow lineage tree; fitness-over-time + generation-comparison charts; energy-per-agenome; candidate inspector; critic-gauntlet panel; subtype-check evidence; **final surviving idea** proof panel (links to lineage, critics, checks, score components, energy, traces); run stop control.

**Real-time in-flight window (resolved).** The dashboard is the live observatory, not a poll-and-refresh view: it folds the SSE stream (completion events **+ operation-start markers**, §4/§11) into a per-node **working / in-flight** sub-state — a lineage node visibly *generating* / *reviewing* / *checking* / *fusing* until its completion event clears it — plus a **live activity feed** (operation start→finish) and an **in-flight summary** (how many agenomes/critics/checks/judge/fusions are working *right now*, from `GET /runs/:id/health`). Energy meters drain live on `energy.spent`; the fitness chart climbs live on `fitness.scored`; failures (`provider_call_failed`, `energy_exhausted`, `novelty_scoring_degraded`) surface live, not only in logs. Because the markers are persisted, **replay reproduces the identical in-flight choreography** — the fallback demo looks the same as live.

**Accessibility / projector robustness (resolved):** status uses **shape/label/icon in addition to color** (colorblind-safe palette), a high-contrast theme, and projector-legible font sizes — the dashboard is a first-class acceptance surface shown to a room.

**Final-idea proof panel (resolved — PD.7):** the final surviving-idea panel labels the **transfer-evidence rung** — *live allowlisted (non-executing)* vs *replay-backed* — **derived from the run mode** (live/replay), a presentation of mode, not a re-judgement (the held-out judge/scoring stay immutable, rule #6 emit-only); it renders the winner's `evidenceRefs` **in-tier** via the shared `EvidenceRefLink` (rule #9 — never an external href); and it reflects **terminal zero-survivors** — a terminal run (`run.completed/failed/stopped`) with no kernel/judge-selected winner shows the terminal state, never a fabricated idea (vs the in-progress affordance). **Zero new contract surface:** the label reads the existing run `mode` (the frozen `CheckResult` carries no live/replay discriminator), the terminal branch the existing run-level `RunEventType`.

**Frontend-v2 — multi-route app (FV.1).** The dashboard is no longer a single `<Dashboard>` mount — it is a multi-route app (`react-router-dom` v7) behind a global **AppShell** (the `◆ Doppl` wordmark + a ModeBanner slot + a dark/high-contrast/light **theme toggle** persisted to `localStorage['doppl-theme']`, applied to `document.documentElement` per the DS `:root.hc`/`:root.light` scopes, dark default). Routes: `/` (S0 Runs Home) · `/launch` (S1) · `/runs/:id` (S2 organism, live) · `/runs/:id/replay` (S2 replay) · `/runs/:id/final` (S5). The **observed run + mode are URL-derived** (replacing the prior internal observe-state; a per-URL `key=mode:id` remount tracks it); the data layer stays **route-agnostic** — `runClient` is app-level (a `RunClientProvider` context + `useRunClient`), the per-`(runId,mode)` store + SSE wiring + the PD.20 re-fetch unchanged. FV.1 mounts the existing tested Dashboard per-route (reuse, not rebuild — `/launch` interim-redirects to `/`, `/runs/:id/final` interim-mounts Dashboard); the dedicated DS screens land in FV.2 (S0) · FV.3 (S1) · FV.4 (S2 3-pane) · FV.7 (S5). Read-only over projections (rule #9): routing/theme are presentation; no authoritative state mutated.

**Frontend-v2 — live observatory telemetry (FV.6).** The S2 organism view's live-telemetry panels — `ActivityTicker` (the kernel RunEvent feed), `HealthIndicator` (the §11 continue-vs-switch cockpit gauge), `RunEnergyGauge` (the run-wide draining charge), and the fitness chart's mean series — are fed by **pure event-derived selectors** over the `useRunObservatory` SSE fold + the health projection (`deriveTickerEvents` / `toHealthSummary` / `deriveHealthStatus` / `energyBudgetProgress`): sequence-ordered, verbatim payload reads, never reordered by `occurredAt`. The run-**health STATUS** (healthy→stalled) is a **client-side last-event-age threshold** — a display derivation only; the underlying health signal + the exhaustion/terminal DECISIONS stay the kernel's/API's (rule #2, never re-derived client-side). Read-only over projections (rule #9); replay-identical from persisted events (rule #7 — the selectors are pure, no provider call). Zero contract surface (the web-local `RunHealth` schema unchanged).

**Frontend-v2 — S5 Final-Idea / payoff screen (FV.7).** The dedicated `/runs/:id/final` screen (`S5FinalIdeaScreen`) COMPOSES the already-shipped `FinalIdeaPanel` (winner card + proof: fitness, energy, critic gauntlet, subtype checks, transfer-evidence label, traces, evidence links) + the generational-climb chart (`GenerationComparison`) via the shared `useRunObservatory` hook, replacing the FV.1 interim Dashboard mount. The winner is the kernel/projection-marked `'selected'` candidate (the PD.11 `finalIdeaRef`→`selected` bridge — zero new surface; the screen re-ranks nothing, rule #6 emit-only); terminal zero-survivors renders the honest terminal state, never a fabricated idea. Read-only over projections (rule #9); replay-identical (rule #7). Zero contract surface.

**Frontend-v2 — replay scrubber (FV.8).** The S2 organism view in REPLAY mode mounts a step scrubber that re-folds `events[0..N]` client-side via the PURE `foldEvents` reduce (`foldAtStep`), rendering the fold-derived panels (ActivityTicker + fitness/energy charts) as of step N — replay reproduces the in-flight choreography step-by-step with NO provider call / no refetch (rule #7). Replay-mode-only by construction (in live mode the panels read the identity fold — `foldAtStep` is never called — so the live path is unchanged); the projection-derived lineage node-structure stays full (a fold-prefix rewinds the in-flight overlay, not the node set — a flagged limitation). Read-only over projections (rule #9). Zero contract surface.
- **FV.2 (`5ee233b`)** shipped **S0 Runs Home** at `/` (machine-truth-minimal run cards off `RunSummary`, status-derived Open/Replay/Final actions, New Run → `/launch`); it repointed `/launch` to the interim Dashboard launcher (preserves start-a-run). **FV.4 (`8e6400d`)** shipped the **S2 3-pane Organism View** at `/runs/:id[/replay]` — LEFT (StopControl + an agent roster derived from the lineage agenome nodes) · CENTER (the reused `LineageGraph`, live) · RIGHT (an inspector drawer SLOT) — re-homing the tested live wiring (the store/SSE fold + the PD.20 re-fetch) into a shared `useRunObservatory` hook; the node-click→inspector content is FV.5, the telemetry polish FV.6.

## §13 — Observability

**LLM observability:** Langfuse Cloud (non-authoritative). LLM-related events store Langfuse trace/observation IDs + model metadata; if Langfuse is unavailable the event log retains local trace metadata sufficient for demo/debug (`REQ-I-006`, ADR-005). A local-only warning flags a failed Langfuse export (no event-log entry — it's non-authoritative). **Content toggle (Q3):** an operator switch disables external content logging to Langfuse when a live audience prompt may be sensitive.

**Runtime self-observability (resolved — new category):** structured kernel logs with run/generation/agenome correlation IDs; a worker-alive heartbeat event; `GET /runs/:id/health` (§11). Console + Postgres only — no external metrics stack for MVP.

**The real-time window into a running organism is delivered by the event stream, not by logs.** The authoritative, replay-faithful "what is every agent doing right now" surface is the §4 completion events **+ operation-start markers** streamed over SSE and rendered live (§12) — logs/health are the operator's diagnostic backstop, and Langfuse is the deep per-call trace. Three layers, one truth: **events** (live + replay window into the organism), **kernel logs/health** (operator diagnostics), **Langfuse** (LLM-call latency/cost/tokens).

## §14 — Security & trust boundaries

  ES -.derived-only.-> NEO[Neo4j]
```

Trust boundaries + threats are enumerated in `THREAT_MODEL.md` (T-001..T-010) and `RISKS.md`; this section names the **mechanisms** (the audit's "rules without mechanisms" fix):
- **Model output is untrusted** until schema-validated; candidate text is isolated as data (§7 mechanism). The gateway's Zod validate/repair/reject is the authoritative check — provider strict structured-output is an optimization only, relaxed to `json_object` where a schema exceeds a provider's strict subset (PD.13, §6), with the target shape conveyed as candidate-independent system text.
- **Check-runner allowlist** registry + non-executing adapters; unsafe/unregistered → `skipped` (§7).
- **Secret redaction at the persistence boundary (resolved):** a single scrub function runs in `event-store` on every payload **before append**, and in `observability` **before Langfuse emit** — pattern-based over key formats/Authorization headers/env values, plus the structural guarantee that credentials load only from env and are never threaded into persisted request/response objects. This covers the over-persisted raw model outputs (`RISK-006/009`). The canonical scrub is `scrubSecrets(payload)` with the stable `REDACTION_PLACEHOLDER` token, frozen in `packages/contracts` (P0.2); it implements the **key-format + key-name** layers, with the **env-value** layer (matching payload strings against loaded `process.env` secrets) applied at the boundary where env loads (event-store before append, observability before Langfuse emit). The env-value layer redacts **object keys and array elements as well as string values** (with de-collision to avoid key-collision data loss): `RunEventEnvelope.payload` is an open-key `z.record(z.string(), z.unknown())` — as is `GENERIC_PAYLOAD_SCHEMA` (the 30/36 non-high-traffic event types) — so **producer-controlled keys reach the append path**, and a values-only scrub would leak a non-pattern secret used as a payload key verbatim into the authoritative log (P1.2 `[high]` finding; `apps/api/LESSONS` §21).
- **Caps enforced in runtime, not prompts; event log append-only; SSE read-only, REST is the write path.**
- **Held-out judge/rubric + scoring policy are immutable to agents** (§7/§8) — the bedrock anchor.
- **Access gate (Q3 = local-first, deferred but seam specified):** the showcase is presented **locally — no public URL, no auth build**. If hosted is later pursued, the *seam* is: gate mutating endpoints (`POST /runs`, `/stop`) behind a single shared-secret/basic-auth middleware in `apps/api`; `GET`/stream stay open for read-only reviewers. Product-level multi-user auth stays deferred (`REQ-S-005`).

## §15 — Cross-cutting concerns

- **Configuration / env (resolved):** all config files (model registry, scoring policy, runtime caps, demo problem sets) are **Zod-validated at startup**; required env (provider keys, DB URL) is **fail-fast checked at boot** with a clear error; precedence is `defaults < file < env`. A "config loads & validates" smoke is on the rehearsal checklist. The canonical boot-validation entry is `validateRunConfig(sources)` in `packages/contracts` (P0.3) — a PURE deep-merge over `{defaults, file, env}` (nested objects merge field-by-field; arrays/scalars replace; JS-internal keys `__proto__`/`constructor`/`prototype` skipped) + Zod validation that throws a field-identifying error; the boot layer performs the file/env reads and passes the loaded sources in (IO stays at the boundary). The committed `.env.example` (PD.8b) documents the demo env surface — the closed credential set (`REQUIRED_CREDENTIAL_ENV`) + the config-override allowlist (`ENV_ALLOWLIST`) + the boot-orchestration vars (`BOOT_ORCHESTRATION_ENV`) — single-sourced from those code constants via a drift-guard test (it imports them and asserts key-set equality both directions, so the example can't drift from what boot reads), with rule-#4 placeholders only (non-vacuous real-key guard). Langfuse env is omitted (P2.8-deferred — `packages/observability` reads no env, so there are no Langfuse vars to list).
- **Determinism / RNG, energy accounting, clock authority:** see §4 (per-run seed + persisted outcomes; pre/post energy reconciliation; `occurredAt` = UTC ISO-8601 stamped by Postgres at append, ordering by `sequence` only).
- **Concurrency:** one active run at a time (§5).
- **Data retention / PII (resolved):** idea content is treated as **non-sensitive demo data**; live audience prompts are ephemeral demo input; **no PII expected** and operators must not enter sensitive prompts; Langfuse content logging is toggle-able (§13). Anything beyond this is deferred.

## §16 — Testing strategy

MVP floor (must-pass, traceable to `REQ-T-*`): cap enforcement **fails closed** + **operator-stop/kill** moves to terminal & preserves partial evidence (`REQ-T-002`, `REQ-F-012`); event append + **replay state-equivalence** reconstruction incl. an **older-`schemaVersion` fixture** (`REQ-T-003`); **RNG-replay determinism** (replay reproduces identical agenome traits + selection decisions); structured-output **validate + repair/reject** (`REQ-T-004`); critic/check schema validation; scoring-component calc; novelty fixture; lineage projection rebuild; SSE disconnect/resync; deterministic seed→summary fixture run (`REQ-T-001`).
**Contract tests (resolved — `RISK-014`, add `REQ-T-007`):** every consumer of a shared schema agrees with the producer on payload shapes (the `contracts` package gate that the parallel-track plan depends on).
**Safety tests (resolved — promote from RISK register):** secret-redaction (no key in any event/trace/UI payload), check-runner allowlist rejection, prompt-injection fixture (injected candidate cannot move scoring/anchors or trigger an unpermitted tool).
**UI:** one Playwright happy-path smoke (start → live events → final-idea panel links resolve).
**Demo rehearsals (`REQ-T-005`):** one successful prepared run; one provider-failure → replay fallback; one low-cap live run; final-idea evidence walkthrough; the **fallback ladder** (§17); a config-validation boot smoke. Langfuse trace-correlation is a **manual/local smoke**, not CI-gating; CI asserts the trace-id field is carried when enabled and degrades cleanly when disabled (`REQ-T-006`).

## §17 — Deployment & demo strategy

**Local-first is the demo of record (Q3).** Identical boot sequence local & hosted: `migrate → seed replay fixture → start API/web`, parameterized only by env. Postgres local/containerized; Langfuse optional; the full demo path runs locally with replay data even if hosted is unavailable (`REQ-O-005`, ADR-009). **Hosted is a deferred stretch** (seam preserved; no week-one hosting/access-control work).

**Prepared-replay pipeline (resolved — the safety net's mechanics):** an export (`GET /runs/:id/replay` or a `dump-replay` script) writes an ordered `run_events` JSON artifact under `fixtures/replay/<runId>.json` with its `schemaVersion` recorded; a `seed-demo` script loads it into the demo DB **after migrations**; the artifact is committed and **regenerated on `schemaVersion` bumps**.

**Creds-free e2e (resolved — PD.8a).** The prepared-replay pipeline is CI-asserted end-to-end **without provider credentials**: a committed `fixtures/replay/demo-recorded-001.json` (captured once via a gated `DOPPL_CAPTURE_FIXTURE=1` tool driving the REAL worker on a loop-capable recorded gateway to a winning `run.completed`) + a creds-free e2e smoke that boots the real stack (`bootApp`: migrate → `seedDemo` → start) against real Postgres + the recorded gateway and asserts the run reconstructs to a terminal, the final-idea projection resolves a `'selected'` winner (the §10/§12 winner bridge, PD.11), replay makes zero provider calls (rule #7), and replay state-equivalence holds (§4). Documented commands: `pnpm -C apps/api test:smoke:demo` (the smoke) + `capture:demo-fixture` (re-record on a `schemaVersion` bump). Replay needs no keys, so the proof needs none.

**Live headline e2e (resolved — PD.8c, user decision).** The PRIMARY demo proof runs LIVE (`DOPPL_GATEWAY=live`) against real LLMs at a low cap, asserting INVARIANTS (reaches terminal · caps enforced rule #1 · a `'selected'` winner resolves via the PD.11 bridge · energy success-only rule #8 · no provider-key value leaks into any persisted event rule #4) — never exact model text (live is non-deterministic). It is OPT-IN (`pnpm -C apps/api test:smoke:live`, `skipIf` no `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) and **NOT a CI gate** — the creds-free PD.8a smoke is the keyless CI base. rule #7 is preserved by capturing the live run's events + replaying them (state-equivalence + zero-provider); the keyless-un-executable live assertions are de-risked by a keyless mirror running the same invariant helpers against the committed recorded run. The live capture is transient; the operator re-records a committed live fixture only if the demo-of-record should itself be a real run (cost/non-determinism tradeoff).

**Fallback ladder (resolved — operator-driven, rehearsed):** (1) attempt live low-cap run; (2) on stall/failure the operator manually switches to a prepared known-good run; (3) if that fails, a clearly-labeled **replay** of a recorded run. Manual (not auto) so the operator controls stage timing. The demo override only **lowers** caps within validated maxima — the Browser→API cap-max validation still rejects any override above the ceiling.

**Demo path:** prepared **or operator-entered live** prompt → live SSE run → generation improvement → lineage specialization → critic/check evidence → final surviving idea → (transfer) live allowlisted check or replay-backed.

**Phase-D implementation status (PD.1–PD.4 + PD.9, demo track — rounds 1–2; cody reconcile at phase-end).** The boot root `apps/api/src/main.ts` (`bootApp`) runs the sequence above: `loadConfig` (fail-fast env — names the var, no value echo, rule #4) → `migrate` → **seed** (env-gated `DOPPL_SEED_FIXTURE` + `DOPPL_FIXTURE_DIR`; absent → a no-op live boot) → `crashForward` (AWAITED before listen, §5) → `buildServer` → `listen`; a missing/invalid fixture ABORTS boot before serving. Gateway is env-switched (`DOPPL_GATEWAY`, default `recorded` — local-first; **PD.9** wired `live` → `createLiveGateway` feeds the real OpenRouter adapter into the SAME `createGateway` (discipline inherited), built lazily from env only when `live`, key env-only/rule #4, SDK behind the `OpenRouterClient` seam/rule #9; `selectGateway` honest-throws if live deps are absent — no silent fake fallback). `dump-replay.ts` exports a TERMINAL run validated through `replayEvents` (top-level `schemaVersion = max(rows)`, path-guarded); `seed-demo.ts` RESTORES it via a direct sequence/occurredAt-preserving insert under the append-only INSERT-allowed trigger (idempotent `onConflictDoNothing` on `(run_id,sequence)`), validating each event vs `RunEventEnvelope` (null-stripped copy) + `validateEventPayload` before insert (never seed a row that fails on read). `POST /runs/:id/stop` SIGNALS the kernel operator-stop kill-and-drain (returns `202 stopRequested`; the worker drains the current generation + terminalizes `run.stopped` `running→stopping`, actor `runtime`; the route appends nothing — rule #2). **PD.4 (round 2):** the fallback ladder is a PURE in-memory operator controller (`runtime/demo/fallback-ladder.ts` `createFallbackLadder`) over three rungs — rung 1 low-cap-live (mode `live`) → rung 2 prepared (mode `live`) → rung 3 labeled replay (mode `replay`); rungs advance ONLY on an explicit operator call (no timer/auto-fallback — manual stage timing), the operator may jump to any rung, end-of-ladder `advance()` CLAMPS at replay; it holds NO authoritative state (switching performs zero writes, mutates no prior run — rule #2) and exposes plain serializable rung descriptors (string-union kind/mode) the PD.6 UI consumes. The demo cap-override (`runtime/demo/demo-cap-override.ts` `applyDemoCapOverride`) only LOWERS caps within validated maxima (`> maxima` rejected, `≤` allowed — EXACT parity with the route's `overCapField`; `RunCaps.parse` backstop closes coercion gaps); it is defense-in-depth operator-input validation that DEFERS to the kernel/route as the sole cap authority (rule #1), never a second authority — an above-ceiling `POST /runs` is still `422`'d and appends zero `run.configured`. PD.4's production wiring is deferred to PD.5 (write-path) + PD.6 (UI); the live rung's real execution is now UNBLOCKED (PD.9 wired the live gateway). **PD.10 (user-decided Option B — DONE `8337e59`+`c88bb4a`)** threaded the per-run problem (`RunConfig.seed`, previously dropped in `mergePerRunConfig`) into agenome generation as rule-#5 `wrapUntrusted` DATA (`system = agenome.systemPrompt` trusted instruction + a fixed `GENERATION_ISOLATION_FRAMING` + `user = wrapUntrusted(problem)` untrusted subject; the contracts-level primitive, not the verifier assembler) AND validated the generation OUTPUT — the `population_generator` call passes a runtime-local `CandidateContent` (a `discriminatedUnion` `.omit(kernel-fields {id,runId,generationId,agenomeId,status})` derivation of the frozen `CandidateIdea`) so the gateway runs validate/repair(≤1)/reject → a malformed real-model output yields a graceful `agenome.failed` (not the prior accept-then-append `shape_mismatch` crash). The held-out judge stays problem-free + immutable (rule #6 — the seed's only consumer is the generation call); energy #8 + replay #7 preserved. **PD.5 COMPLETE (round 2)** — the operator-prompt path: **PD.5a** added a read-only `GET /problem-sets` exposing the boot prepared-problem catalog (`config.problemSets`); **PD.5b** added the web `OperatorPromptPanel` (pick a prepared problem OR type a freeform prompt → both become the run `seed` → a partial `{seed}` POST through the existing `POST /runs` deep-merge (`validateRunConfig` defaults<file<env) → the existing Dashboard shell handoff for the live view). No api config-builder was needed (the planned `demo-run-config.ts` was dropped); `ProblemSet` is a web-local Zod mirror (no contracts change). **PD.6 (round 2)** surfaced the operator continue-vs-switch signal — `RunHealthPanel` renders `GET /runs/:id/health` (generation / in-flight / last-event-at / caps-where-exposed) with a colorblind-safe stale/absent flag (a pure `isStale` + a ~2s re-eval tick so a STALLED stream flips to stale even with no new events; an INLINE shape+icon+label badge, deliberately not the frozen-contract status-map); the existing P7.4 `ModeBanner` is reused as the live/replay indicator. Read-only over projections+SSE (resync from `lastEventId`, rule #3). _(Two integration carry-forwards at the demo→cody merge: reconcile the web-local `RunHealth` schema vs the api shape — LESSON 34; wire the EventSource connection-drop `'error'` listener.)_ PD.7–PD.8 (final-idea proof panel, §16 rehearsals) — completed; see the continuation below.

**Phase-D status (continued — PD.7/8/11–16; rounds 3–5).** **PD.7** final-idea proof panel (§12 rung-label-from-mode + terminal-zero-survivors; `1277cd1`). **PD.8a** creds-free e2e + committed `demo-recorded-001` fixture (`0245b46`); **PD.8c** the live headline e2e (`baf4d14`) — live-EXECUTED **10/10, a real `'selected'` winner produced** (after PD.13); **PD.8b** `DEMO_RUNBOOK.md` + single-sourced `.env.example` (`0949283`). **PD.11** the `winnerReducer` projection bridge marks the `run.completed.finalIdeaRef` candidate `'selected'` (`4607369` — the §10/§12 winner every read surface keys off). **PD.12** wired PD.4's fallback-ladder route + cap-override into production (`1b55ef4`/`3c304d8`/`b2c38c5`). **PD.13** relaxed the provider structured-output to `json_object` (`cdef9e2`, §6/§14). **PD.14** the Vite dev proxy + env baseUrl + a REAL web→proxy→API smoke (`fb27d73`) — which surfaced a web↔API response-shape drift the mocked e2e had hidden, closed by **PD.15** (the read-path + SSE omit-null serializer + web consuming the real shapes; `3b3d476`, §11) + **PD.16** (operator start/stop command shapes). The local web↔API path is now the Vite dev proxy (`/api`→:3000); the live demo's interactive operator Start/Stop works against the real API. `/phase-exit PD` close + the phase-d→cody merge are lead-owned (user sign-off).

## §18 — Scope boundaries & deferred work

**Deferred (flagged):** open-ended multi-hour evolution; learned bandit/RL allocation + **learned value model & credit assignment (`REQ-DEF-010`)**; self-evolving critic council; in-house fine-tuning flywheel; weight-level model fusion; DPP/MAP-Elites; production accounts/workspaces/admin/**rollback**/long-term ops; WebSocket-first control; Neo4j runtime dependency; LangSmith; SQLite; pgvector day-one (vectors still persisted); hosted deployment + access gate for this showcase; per-version `schemaVersion` upcasters (re-record fixture instead); idempotent crash-resume (crash-forward instead); external metrics stack; secrets rotation / audit admin / production alerting; **concurrent multi-run execution** (MVP serializes one active run; concurrent is a stretch).

**Required early spikes (`REQ-I-*`):** OpenRouter structured-output route + **rate-limit/account** check via the gateway; provider cost/latency → set the energy/cost ceiling + lock model routes (`OQ-005/006/013`); embeddings via direct OpenAI; **retrieval/web-search grounding source** + the static-corpus fallback (new, per Q2); Langfuse account + trace correlation; pgvector enablement (timeboxed go/no-go); Neo4j lineage queries (week-2, ~1 day).

## §19 — Alternatives & locked decisions

Full ADR rationale lives in `DECISIONS.md` (ADR-001..010, re-anchored per `docs/gap-audits/anchor-remap.md`). Locked baseline: custom TypeScript kernel (not LangGraph-as-runtime); Postgres append-only event log (not current-rows/SQLite/Neo4j-as-truth); provider-agnostic gateway, OpenRouter primary (not direct-OpenAI-primary, not SDKs-in-domain); Langfuse Cloud (not self-hosted/LangSmith/Doppl-only); simple embedding novelty (not DPP/MAP-Elites); lineage projection-first + Neo4j spike (not Neo4j runtime); React Flow (not Cytoscape/D3); REST+SSE (not WebSocket-first); local-first + hosted (not hosted-only/local-only). **Decisions added at this gate:** held-out judge + critic rotation (`REQ-F-016`); both subtypes equal + live web-search grounding with curated/replay fallback (Q2); local-first demo, prepared + optional-live prompt, hosted deferred (Q3); Zod-authored contracts; in-process single-active-run worker; energy unit + cost map; crash-forward recovery; embeddings authoritative-once-computed.

## §20 — Open questions

Carried forward (with recorded MVP fallbacks): exact scoring-component **weights** (structure frozen, values post-spike, `OQ-002/003`); exact OpenRouter model routes (`OQ-005/006`); **retrieval/web-search provider** choice + cost/rate-limit envelope (new, Q2; static corpus is the fallback); exact population/generation/token/time **defaults** (`OQ-013`, post-spike); pgvector day-one vs app-cosine (`OQ-007`, app-cosine default); Neo4j spike exact queries (`OQ-009`); Rule-of-Cool reuse depth (`OQ-010`, conceptual-reference default → §`REQ-F-017` seed authoring); exact demo problem sets (`OQ-001/012`). None block the contract freeze.

## §21 — Diagrams index

P0 diagrams embedded above: full-scope overview (§2), subsystem DAG (§2.5), event-truth/replay (§4), run-lifecycle sequence (§5), model-gateway routing (§6), lineage/Neo4j (§10), dashboard data plane (§12), trust boundaries (§14). P1/P2 (scoring/novelty pipeline, deployment/demo topology, repo scaffold) remain in `DIAGRAM_PLAN.md` (anchors re-pointed via `anchor-remap.md`).

## Appendix A — Model / contract inventory

Cross-doc invariants — mirrored in the area `CLAUDE.md` cross-doc invariants table. A field change requires editing this appendix **and** the model's `§` section in the same round of commits. A model whose `§` is crossed by a §2.5 edge is a **shared contract across tracks** — freeze before parallel tracks fork. All authored as **Zod** schemas (`z.infer` for types). Numeric scoring **weights** are the only deferred-open values.

| Model | Section | Fields (summary) | Shared across tracks |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RunEventEnvelope` | §4 | id, runId, generationId?, agenomeId?, candidateId?, type:`RunEventType`, sequence, occurredAt(UTC, append-stamped), actor(7-role union), correlationId?, langfuseTraceId?, langfuseObservationId?, payload(JSONB, per-type narrowed), schemaVersion | **yes (all)** |
| `RunEventType` | §4 | closed enum: run.configured/started/completed/failed/stopped; generation.started/completed; agenome.spawned/fused/mutated/reproduced; candidate.created; critic.reviewed; check.completed; judge.reviewed (held-out-judge acceptance result — narrows to `JudgeResult`, the terminal half of judge.review_started); novelty.scored; fitness.scored; lineage.culled; energy.spent; + failure events: provider_call_failed, output_schema_rejected, candidate_invalidated, energy_exhausted, generation_failed, reproduction_aborted_insufficient_parents, novelty_scoring_degraded; + operation-start / in-flight markers (live observability, replay-faithful, no energy debit): generation.verifying, generation.scoring, generation.reproducing, candidate.generation_started, critic.review_started, check.started, novelty.scoring_started, judge.review_started, fusion.started, tool_call.started, tool_call.finished | **yes** |
| per-type payload map (`HIGH_TRAFFIC_PAYLOAD_MAP`, `resolvePayloadSchema`, `validateEventPayload`, `enforcePayloadCeiling`, `GENERIC_PAYLOAD_SCHEMA`, `MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES`, `MAX_PAYLOAD_DEPTH`) | §4 | narrowing layer over the generic `RunEventEnvelope.payload` (does NOT mutate the frozen envelope): maps the 7 high-traffic types (energy.spent←EnergyEvent, candidate.created←CandidateIdea, critic.reviewed←CriticReview, check.completed←CheckResult, novelty.scored←NoveltyScore, fitness.scored←FitnessScore, judge.reviewed←JudgeResult) to their frozen model; own-property resolver fails open to generic JSONB for other types, fails closed (reject) on a high-traffic mismatch; bounded ceiling `MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES`=1_048_576 / `MAX_PAYLOAD_DEPTH`=32 (depth-before-size, result-object, never throws, literal-value-pinned); `validateEventPayload` composes narrow+ceiling for the P1 append path (P0.10) | **yes (event-store·projection)** |
| `RunConfig` / `RunCaps` | §4, §5 | RunConfig{seed, enabledSubtypes[], caps:RunCaps, modelProfile, scoringPolicyVersion, rngSeed, generationOperators?, generationBias?, modelRouteOverride?}; RunCaps{maxPopulation, maxGenerations, energyBudget(doppl_energy), maxSpawnDepth, maxToolCalls, wallClockTimeoutMs}. **FB.0 (sv6, frontend-v2):** 3 OPTIONAL run-controls — `generationOperators?` (array of the closed 7-member `GenerationOperator` mutagen-skill enum) + `generationBias?` (number ∈ [−1,+1], the diverge/converge GENERATION hint, 0 neutral) are GENERATION inputs (rule #5 DATA, rule-#6-safe — never scoring/judge inputs); `modelRouteOverride?` (`partialRecord(ModelRole, strict {provider,modelId})`) is allowlist-CLAMPED at runtime (FB.2), the contract fixes shape only. Additive/backward-compatible; runtime honoring = FB.1–FB.4. | **yes** |
| `Agenome` | §3 | id, runId, generationId, parentIds[], systemPrompt, personaWeights, toolPermissions[], decompositionPolicy, spawnBudget(hint), mutationMeta?, status(7-state) | **yes (kernel·reproduction·event-store)** |
| `CandidateIdea` (+ `CrossDomainTransferPayload`, `ZeitgeistSynthesisPayload`) | §3 | id, runId, generationId, agenomeId, subtype(`cross_domain_transfer`\|`zeitgeist_synthesis`), title, summary, claims[], evidenceRefs[], status(closed 9: created/repairing/under_review/checked/scored/selected/rejected/culled/invalid — `repairing` added kernel-020/sv4 for the §3 `created→repairing→under_review` FIX edge), subtypePayload(discriminated); CrossDomainTransferPayload{sourceDomain, sourceTechnique, targetDomain, targetProblem, transferMapping, expectedMechanism, executableCheckIdea?}; ZeitgeistSynthesisPayload{thesis, audience, currentSignals[], whyNow, falsifiablePredictions[], comparablePriorArt[]} | **yes (runtime·verifier·selection·projection)** |
| `EvidenceRef` | §4 | kind(trace/check_output/prior_art/signal/raw_output/other), eventId?/uri?, label?, langfuseObservationId? — resolves within Postgres tier | **yes** |
| `CriticReview` (+ `CriticMandate`, `criticInput`) | §7 | id, candidateId, mandate(closed union), scores{}, critique, confidence, evidenceRefs[]; criticInput separates rubric vs untrusted candidate | **yes (verifier→selection)** |
| `CheckResult` (+ `CheckRunnerAdapter`) | §7 | id, candidateId, checkType, status(passed/failed/skipped), score?, output?, skipReason?(present iff skipped), evidenceRefs[], error?; `CheckRunnerAdapter` = allowlist-registry descriptor `{id, checkType, subtype?, label?}` — non-executing (no code-carrying field); unregistered id → `skipped` via the pure `resolveCheckAdapter` gate (own-property lookup) | **yes (checks→selection)** |
| `NoveltyScore` | §8 | id, candidateId, vector(persisted, required — replay reads it), embeddingModelId, dimension, comparisonSet, method(open string), score, explanation | **yes** |
| `FitnessScore` / `ScoringPolicy` | §8 | FitnessScore{id, candidateId, total, components{} (open name→number), policyVersion(required — binds to a policy version), explanation}; ScoringPolicy{version, weights{} (open name→number; values deferred-open), normalization?} | **yes (selection→reproduction)** |
| `EnergyEvent` | §4, §5 | id, runId, generationId?, agenomeId?, eventType(llm/tool/spawn), estimate, actual, unit:doppl_energy, reason, providerMeta? | **yes** |
| `ReproductionEvent` | §8 | id, runId, parentAgenomeIds[], childAgenomeId, mode(fusion/crossover/output_synthesis/mutation_only), crossoverPoints(int[]), mutationSummary(record string→string\|number\|boolean) — both required, RNG outcomes persisted | **yes** |
| `ModelRoute` / `ModelRole` / `ProviderCapability` | §6 | role(7 incl. retrieval, final_judge), provider, modelId, capability{structuredOutputs, embeddings, toolCalling?, streaming?}, fallbackRouteIds[] | **yes (gateway→runtime·verifier·selection)** |
| `ModelGatewayRequest` / `ModelGatewayResponse` | §6 | Request{role, prompt XOR messages(messages: {role:ChatRole(system/user/assistant), content}[]), schema?(opaque), maxTokens?, samplingParams?(FB.4), tools?(TU.1 — `ToolDescriptor`{name:`ToolName`, description}[]; population_generator only, rule #6)}; Response{accepted, output?(opaque), validationResult(accepted/repaired/rejected; accepted⇔result≠rejected), providerMeta(= shared `ProviderMeta`{provider, modelId, gatewayRequestId, tokensIn/Out, costEstimate?}, defined P0.9 — P0.12 imports it), langfuseTraceId?, rejection?(={reason}, present iff rejected), toolCallRequests?(TU.1 — `ToolCallRequest`{id, name:`ToolName`, arguments:JSON-string DATA}[])} · **tool-use TU.1 (sv9→10):** `ToolName`=frozen 4-member allowlist (web_search/fetch_url/x_search/youtube_search, rule #3); tools attach ONLY to population_generator → rule-#6 anchor byte-identical; multi-turn message variants (assistant-tool-call echo `{role:'assistant',content,toolCalls[]}` + tool-result `{role:'tool',toolCallId,toolName,content}`, no `ChatRole` widening — TU.5) ride the `messages` union, adapter-translated to the OpenAI tool protocol | **yes** |
| `LineageGraphProjection` (+ `LineageNode`, `LineageNodeType`, `LineageEdge`) | §10 | runId, nodes[{id, type:`LineageNodeType`(closed 6: generation/agenome/candidate/critic/check/score), label, status?(open string — varies by node type), metrics?(record string→number), dataRef(opaque string pointer; resolved by the projection builder, §9)}], edges[{id, source, target, type, label?}], sequenceThrough(int≥0 = per-run watermark, §9) — storage-agnostic (no physical-storage/Neo4j field) | **yes (projection→frontend·neo4j)** |
| `Run` / `Generation` | §3 | Run{id, seed(run/problem-scenario string, = `RunConfig.seed` by name — DISTINCT from the RNG `RunConfig.rngSeed`), enabledSubtypes[] (array of `Subtype`, NO `.min(1)` — count ≥1 is a kernel rule §6, unlike `RunConfig.enabledSubtypes`'s boot gate), caps:RunCaps, status(closed 8: configured/running/completing/completed/stopping/stopped/failed/cancelled), startedAt, completedAt?}; Generation{id, runId, index(int≥0), status(closed 9: pending/running/degraded/verifying/scoring/reproducing/completed/failed/skipped — `degraded` added kernel-020/sv4 for the §3 `running→degraded→verifying` partial-failure FIX edge), startedAt, completedAt?} | **yes (event-store·projection)** |
| `CullingEvent` | §3, §8 | id, runId, generationId, targetIds[] (ids; empty array parses — count is a kernel rule §6), reason, scoreSnapshot(record string→number — inspectable cull justification, §8 explainability) — the persisted shape behind the `lineage.culled` event type | **yes (selection→projection)** |
| `FinalJudgeRubric` (+ `FinalJudgeAxis`) | §7 | Strict 4-field {axes, weights, policyVersion, immutableToAgents}; `axes`=`z.array(FinalJudgeAxis)` (`FinalJudgeAxis` closed 5: grounding/novelty/feasibility/falsification_survival/subtype_check_pass — no agent can add an axis); `weights`=OPEN record string→number (structure frozen, values deferred-open; OPEN admits the §7 non-axis energy-efficiency tiebreak key); `policyVersion`=string.min(1) (= `ScoringPolicy.version` typing — immutability-via-versioning); `immutableToAgents`=`z.literal(true)` (unflippable); NO authority/override/scale field. Held out from the breeding loop (rule #6 anchor). Full-axis-set completeness + no-agent-write-path = P4/P5 runtime (lesson §6) | **yes (verifier→selection)** |
| `JudgeResult` | §7, §8 | The held-out judge's persisted ACCEPTANCE OUTPUT (judge-output amendment). Strict 7-field {id, candidateId, axisScores(`z.record(FinalJudgeAxis, z.number())` — the per-axis 0-5 breakdown over the closed 5 axes; exhaustive+closed so the judge output can't drop/add an axis, rule #6), acceptance(`z.number()` — the overall metric selection consumes), rubricPolicyVersion(`string.min(1)` = `FinalJudgeRubric.policyVersion` typing — immutability-via-versioning), providerMeta(shared `ProviderMeta`, required — rule #4 no-secret + rule #7 replay-faithful provenance), langfuseTraceId?}. UNTRUSTED until schema-validated (rule #5) → strict, so a malformed judge output is rejected at persist; `axisScores`+`acceptance` REQUIRED so replay reads them, never re-judges (rule #7). NO rubric/weights/immutableToAgents/scoreOverride field representable (rule #6, anti-reward-hacking). `judge.reviewed`←`JudgeResult` is the authoritative judge home; fitness references it by `candidateId` join + `components.judge_acceptance` (NOT a duplicate copy), exactly as it references `novelty.scored`. Producer P4.8 (verifier), consumer P5.5 (selection). Frozen `packages/contracts` (P0.16) | **yes (verifier→selection)** |
