## <a id="1"></a>1. Shared contracts are strict closed schemas — `z.strictObject` + `z.enum`, each pinned by a reject-out-of-set test AND a member-set snapshot

**Date:** 2026-06-20.
**Source slice:** contract track P0.1 (`022e9ff`); `packages/contracts`.

Zod's `z.object()` **strips** unknown keys by default — a silent contract hole: an event carrying a stray field would parse, quietly drop the field, and flow downstream as if valid. Every shared contract object therefore uses `z.strictObject({...})` (Zod 4; the v3 `.strict()` is deprecated) so an unknown field is **rejected**, not stripped. Closed unions (`RunEventType`, `Actor`, and every state-machine status union to come) use `z.enum([...])` so an out-of-set value is rejected at the boundary rather than silently admitted.

Because these are §2.5 shared contracts frozen before the tracks fork, a field/member add/remove/rename must surface as a cross-track regression. The schema-snapshot test does this: it asserts the object's field-name set (`Object.keys(Schema.shape)`) and each enum's member set (`Schema.options`) equal a checked-in frozen snapshot, tagged `spec(§4)`. The snapshot guards the *shape*; pair it with a reject-out-of-set test that guards *closure* (the snapshot alone won't catch a union that silently stopped rejecting). Both are required on every contract slice — Step 2.5 confirms both are present.

Edge case still open: the snapshot freezes the field *set*, not each field's value-type — e.g. a `payload` loosened from `z.record(...)` to `z.unknown()` passes the snapshot unchanged. Pin value-type decisions with a dedicated negative test (`envelope_rejects_non_object_payload` in P0.1).

**Rule:** Shared contracts = `z.strictObject` (unknown keys rejected) + closed unions = `z.enum`; each pinned by BOTH a reject-out-of-set test and a member-set/field-name snapshot tagged `spec(§X)`.

## <a id="2"></a>2. Greenfield package toolchain shape — workspace globs + strict `tsconfig.base` + per-package scripts + root `pnpm -r` delegation; TS6 `paths` resolve without `baseUrl`

**Date:** 2026-06-20.
**Source slice:** contract track P0.1 (`20ca1f3`); `packages/contracts`. **Refined:** kernel track P1.1 scaffold (`kernel-001`); `apps/api` — the second package to copy the pattern, which surfaced the sub-package deltas below.

The monorepo bootstrap pattern every later package (`apps/api`, `packages/observability`) copies: `pnpm-workspace.yaml` globs `packages/*` + `apps/*`; a root `tsconfig.base.json` carries the strict family (`strict`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `noImplicitOverride`) and each package `tsconfig.json` extends it; each package owns its `lint`/`format:check`/`typecheck`/`test` scripts; the root `package.json` delegates via `pnpm -r --if-present` so `/preflight` runs identically from the repo root or a package dir (`--if-present` keeps a package lacking a given script from failing the recursion).

Gotcha (TypeScript 6): `baseUrl` is deprecated and **errors** under TS6 — `paths` now resolve **without** `baseUrl`. Configure `paths` directly and do not set `baseUrl`.

Gotcha (Prettier): `prettier --write .` from the repo root reflows EVERY file unless `.prettierignore` scopes it — in this slice it reflowed 63 repo-wide docs before recovery. `.prettierignore` must exclude `**/*.md`, `docs/`, `.claude/`, `.scaffolding/` so Prettier governs code only.

**Second-package deltas (kernel P1.1, `apps/api`).** Copying the shape to a package that (a) carries markdown docs and (b) imports a sibling package's *source* surfaced two refinements `packages/contracts` never hit (it has zero markdown and imports no cross-package source):

- **`format:check` must point at the root ignore.** Prettier resolves `.prettierignore` from the CWD, NOT ancestor dirs — so a bare `prettier --check .` run from `apps/api/` (which holds `CLAUDE.md` + `LESSONS.md`) ignores the root `.prettierignore` and flags those orchestrator-owned docs. A doc-carrying package's `format:check` script must pass `--ignore-path ../../.prettierignore`.
- **No `rootDir` when importing cross-package source via `paths`.** Setting `compilerOptions.rootDir` triggers TS6059 ("not under rootDir") on the sibling package's source pulled in by a `@scope/pkg` `paths` mapping. The base config is `noEmit`, so `rootDir` is cosmetic — omit it. (`packages/contracts` set `rootDir` safely only because it imports no cross-package source.)
- **No per-package ESLint config.** `eslint .` from a package dir discovers the root flat `eslint.config.mjs` — a local config is unnecessary.

**Rule:** New packages copy the P0.1 toolchain shape (workspace globs + strict `tsconfig.base` + per-package scripts + root `pnpm -r --if-present`); set `paths` without `baseUrl` (TS6) and omit `rootDir` when importing cross-package source; scope `.prettierignore` to code only and point a doc-carrying package's `format:check` at the root ignore via `--ignore-path ../../.prettierignore`; no per-package ESLint config (the root flat config resolves).

## <a id="3"></a>3. Secret-redaction scrub — anchored+length-gated value-pattern + sensitive-key whole-value + secret-key de-collision; over-redact but never corrupt

**Date:** 2026-06-20.
**Source slice:** contract track P0.2 (`4b5db40`); `packages/contracts/src/security/redaction.ts`.

The persistence-boundary scrub (§14, key safety rule #4) is pure, idempotent, structure-preserving, non-mutating, and emits normal-prototype output. It runs **before append** and **before Langfuse emit**, so its output *is* the persisted truth — which forces two competing constraints: it must never miss a secret (leak) AND never corrupt legit data (a false-positive is permanent in the log).

Layering: (1) **value-pattern** match for provider keys + Authorization headers — but the pattern MUST be **word-boundary-anchored + length-gated** (`\bsk-[A-Za-z0-9_-]{20,}\b`, `Bearer\s+…{20,}`) or it corrupts prose (`"risk-assessment"` → `"ri[REDACTED]"`); (2) **sensitive key-name** match (case-insensitive contains over `{authorization, api_key, apiKey, secret, token, access_token, client_secret, password}`) that redacts the ENTIRE value regardless of type, so a format-less secret nested under a sensitive key can't escape; (3) secret object **KEYS** are scrubbed too, with **de-collision** (`[REDACTED]`, `[REDACTED]#2`, …) so two redacted-key siblings don't collapse and lose data. Posture: **over-redact** under sensitive keys (a false-positive there is safe; a missed secret is not) — but keep value-pattern matching **precise** (anchored) to protect persisted prose.

The **env-VALUE** layer (comparing payload strings against the actual loaded `process.env` secrets) cannot live in the pure contracts package (no env access, §9 layer rule) — it lands at the boundary (P1 event-store + observability). Security-review the scrub adversarially: this slice took 3 rounds (secret-as-KEY leak, case-sensitivity, `__proto__` data-key drop, key-collision data-loss, null-proto fragility, O(n²) de-collision).

**Rule:** Redaction = anchored+length-gated value-pattern + sensitive-key whole-value + secret-key scrub w/ de-collision; idempotent/structure-preserving/non-mutating/normal-proto; over-redact under sensitive keys but keep patterns precise so persisted prose isn't corrupted; env-value matching lives at the boundary, not the pure package.

## <a id="4"></a>4. `packages/contracts` is pure — all IO (env, file, network, clock) lives at the boundary; validators take loaded sources

**Date:** 2026-06-20.
**Source slice:** contract track P0.2 (`4b5db40`) + P0.3 (`1e4dd4f`).

The contracts package never reads `process.env`, the filesystem, the network, or the clock — it exposes pure functions over data passed in. This surfaced twice: (a) the P0.2 redaction scrub covers key-format + key-name layers, but the **env-value** layer (matching payload strings against the actual loaded `process.env` secrets) can't live here — it lands at the event-store/observability boundary where env loads (human-ratified Option A); (b) P0.3's `validateRunConfig({defaults, file, env})` is a PURE merge+validate — the boot layer does the file/env reads and passes the loaded sources in. The rule generalizes: anything needing ambient IO is plumbed at the infra/boot boundary, never inside `packages/contracts` (§9 layer rule — domain/contracts import only contracts + ports).

Config-merge specifics (P0.3): precedence `defaults < file < env`, **deep** for nested objects (so a layer supplying a partial `caps` overrides one field without wiping the rest), **replace** for arrays + scalars (a higher-layer `enabledSubtypes` replaces, not concatenates). The merge skips JS-internal keys (`__proto__`/`constructor`/`prototype`) — not just pollution-safety: without it a `constructor` config key becomes an own property and `strictObject` throws a confusing `"Unrecognized key: constructor"` boot error while `__proto__` is silently ignored (inconsistent). Validation throws a field-identifying error (wrap `ZodError`) for a clean §15 fail-fast boot message.

**Rule:** Keep `packages/contracts` pure — no env/file/network/clock reads; expose pure functions over loaded sources, and plumb all ambient IO at the boot/infra boundary. Config validators: deep-merge objects / replace arrays+scalars under `defaults<file<env`, skip JS-internal keys, throw field-identifying errors.

## <a id="5"></a>5. A union/type shared by ≥2 models is defined once in its own module and imported — never redefined per model

**Date:** 2026-06-20.
**Source slice:** contract track P0.3 (`1e4dd4f`); `packages/contracts/src/domain/subtype.ts`.

The `Subtype` closed union (`cross_domain_transfer | zeitgeist_synthesis`) is used by `RunConfig.enabledSubtypes` (P0.3) AND `CandidateIdea.subtype` + the discriminated `subtypePayload` (P0.5). Defining it twice would risk divergence (a member added in one place, missed in the other) — a silent cross-model contract break. So the first slice that needs a shared union defines it canonically in its own module (`src/domain/subtype.ts`), exports it from the barrel, and later models import it. This is the §4 single-source-of-truth invariant ("no model is redefined outside contracts") applied at the sub-union level.

**Rule:** When a closed union/type is shared by ≥2 Appendix-A models, define it once in its own module, export from the barrel, and import everywhere — never redefine it per model.

## <a id="6"></a>6. A schema encodes SHAPE, not kernel rules — count/range/clamp invariants live in the kernel, the contract stays permissive

**Date:** 2026-06-20.
**Source slice:** contract track P0.4 (`bdf3816`); `packages/contracts/src/domain/agenome.ts`.

Tempting to encode every rule in the Zod schema. Don't. The contract pins the *structural* shape (field set, types, closed unions, required/optional); behavioral invariants that the kernel polices — counts, ranges, clamps, cross-record relationships — stay OUT of the schema. `Agenome.parentIds` is `array(string)` with NO 0–2 enforcement (the 0–2 relationship is a §3 kernel rule); `spawnBudget` is just a non-negative int hint (the clamp to `min(remaining caps)` is the P3 kernel's job, key safety rule #1). Two reasons: (1) the kernel is the single enforcement point — duplicating a rule in the schema risks the two drifting; (2) if a buggy producer emits an out-of-range value, you want the **kernel to reject it with a persisted event** (auditable), not the schema to throw opaquely at the boundary and mask where the bug came from. The schema is permissive on exactly what the kernel will police.

Corollary (the inverse): values that are purely structural — closed unions, required fields, strict unknown-key rejection, non-empty ids — DO belong in the schema (that's its job). The line is: *structural validity* → schema; *behavioral/relational invariants the kernel owns* → kernel (+ event on violation).

**Rule:** Encode structural shape in the contract (fields, types, closed unions, strict); leave count/range/clamp/relationship invariants to the kernel, which rejects violations with a persisted event — never duplicate a kernel rule in the schema.

## <a id="7"></a>7. A correlated field pair (discriminant + its dependent payload) is a `z.discriminatedUnion` — the correlation is structurally unrepresentable-when-wrong, not checked post-hoc

**Date:** 2026-06-20.
**Source slice:** contract track P0.5 (`49f77f3`); `packages/contracts/src/domain/candidate-idea.ts`.

`CandidateIdea` carries both a `subtype` discriminant AND a `subtypePayload` that must match it (`cross_domain_transfer` ⟺ `CrossDomainTransferPayload`, `zeitgeist_synthesis` ⟺ `ZeitgeistSynthesisPayload`). Modeling this as a flat `z.strictObject` + a `.refine(payload matches subtype)` pushes the correlation into a runtime predicate that (a) can drift from the field set, (b) gives a worse error, and (c) is invisible to the inferred type — a caller could construct a mismatched object in TS. Instead use `z.discriminatedUnion('subtype', [cdtVariant, zeitVariant])`, each variant pinning `subtype: z.literal(Subtype.enum.X)` + its matching payload. A mismatched pair is then *unrepresentable* — rejected by the schema AND a type error in TS — not caught after the fact. This is the structural-validity → schema line from lesson §6: the correlation is structural, so it belongs in the shape.

Two corollaries surfaced and were Step-2.5-approved: (1) the variant literals are `z.literal(Subtype.enum.*)` sourced from the canonical P0.3 `Subtype` (lesson §5) — never re-spelled string literals — so the discriminants can't drift from the shared union; (2) the field-name schema-snapshot for a discriminated union walks `Schema.options` and asserts each variant's `.shape` key-set + the discriminant set, reading the discriminant via a `safeParse` probe (Zod-v4 literals can be multi-value, so `.value` is v3-only) with the expected set sourced from `Subtype.options` — so the snapshot ALSO proves the discriminants ARE the canonical `Subtype` members, catching a Subtype↔CandidateIdea divergence in either direction.

**Rule:** A discriminant + its dependent payload is one `z.discriminatedUnion` (variant literals from the canonical shared union, lesson §5), so a mismatched pair is unrepresentable; snapshot a union by walking `.options` + each variant `.shape`, probing the discriminant via `safeParse` (v4-robust) against the shared union's `.options`.

## <a id="8"></a>8. An injection-isolation contract = trusted-instructions vs untrusted-data as distinct fields + a single-source sentinel-wrap primitive that NEUTRALIZES embedded delimiters

**Date:** 2026-06-20.
**Source slice:** contract track P0.6 (`dfd651f`); `packages/contracts/src/verifier/critic-input.ts`.

`criticInput` models the trusted rubric and the untrusted candidate as DISTINCT named fields, so candidate text is structurally *data to evaluate*, never interpolated into an instruction string (§14 / T-002 / RISK-008, safety rule #5). The single-source wrap primitive — `wrapUntrusted(text)` + the exported `CRITIC_INPUT_SENTINEL` constant — lives IN the frozen contracts package (parallels lesson §3, redaction-in-contract), so every consumer wraps identically rather than each re-implementing (and mis-implementing) isolation.

The load-bearing part: the candidate is **attacker-controlled** (an agenome evolving under selection pressure can emit injection text), and the contract is open-source, so a fixed "collision-unlikely" token defends accidents, not adversaries. `wrapUntrusted` therefore **neutralizes** any occurrence of the sentinel inside `text` (`text.replaceAll(SENTINEL, marker)`) so the output holds the sentinel **exactly twice** (the wrappers) for ANY input — an adversarial candidate cannot forge a delimiter boundary and break out into the instruction region. The neutralization is **provably single-pass-complete**: the marker contains a character ABSENT from the sentinel (so a removed sentinel's neighbours can't splice into a new one) AND the sentinel has no self-overlap (no `<<<`/`>>>` prefix-suffix collision) → no re-scan `while` loop, a linear DoS bound on attacker input. A stronger future hardening — a per-call **nonce** delimiter sourced from the run RNG — belongs to the prompt-rendering layer (verifier track P4), not the pure contract (no RNG here, lesson §4); neutralization is sufficient at the contract tier.

**Rule:** Model trusted instructions vs untrusted data as distinct contract fields + a single-source sentinel-wrap primitive in the frozen package; the wrap MUST neutralize embedded sentinels (output has the sentinel exactly twice for any input), and make that neutralization single-pass-complete (marker holds a char the sentinel lacks; sentinel has no self-overlap) so it's safe AND linear on adversarial input.

## <a id="9"></a>9. An "this actor emits evidence only" invariant is pinned structurally — strict field-set + snapshot make a winner/policy field unrepresentable

**Date:** 2026-06-20.
**Source slice:** contract track P0.6 (`dfd651f`); `packages/contracts/src/verifier/critic-review.ts`.

Critics never select winners, mutate candidates/lineage, or alter the scoring policy (§7, safety rule #6 — anti-reward-hacking). Encode that as the **absence** of any such field rather than a runtime guard: `CriticReview` is a `z.strictObject` of exactly its 7 evidence fields, so a payload adding `winner`/`selected`/`scoreOverride`/`policyVersion` is rejected at parse, and the frozen field-name snapshot makes adding such a field later a caught regression. The invariant becomes a *shape* property — a critic literally cannot express a winner-selection because the contract has no field for it, and there's no enforcement code to forget or bypass. Generalizes to other emit-only actors (the held-out judge, check-runners): pin "can only emit evidence" by giving the shape no authority field.

**Application — rule #8 success-only accounting (P0.9, `a13d9cc`).** The same no-X-field-via-shape technique pins the energy ledger: `EnergyEvent` is a strict object with NO `failed`/`retried`/`repaired`/`success` field and a closed `eventType` (llm/tool/spawn, no failure member), so a failed-attempt energy debit is **unrepresentable** — energy debits only on success; failures are a separate `provider_call_failed` event. `estimate` + `actual` are both required. The snapshot adds a `not-contains` assertion over the forbidden field names for extra clarity (the full field-set snapshot already catches any addition).

**Rule:** Pin an "emit-only / no-authority" invariant structurally — `z.strictObject` of exactly the evidence fields + a field-name snapshot — so an authority field (winner/policy/override) is unrepresentable, not merely rejected by runtime code. (Same technique pins success-only accounting: the spend event has no failure field — rule #8.)

## <a id="10"></a>10. An all-negative (reject-only) test leads with a positive guard so it can't false-pass when the schema/export vanishes

**Date:** 2026-06-20.
**Source slice:** contract track P0.6 (`dfd651f`); `packages/contracts/test/verifier/critic-review.test.ts`.

A test whose every assertion expects *rejection* (e.g. "`winner`/`selected`/`scoreOverride`/`policyVersion` all rejected") can **false-pass** if the schema import is `undefined` — `undefined.parse(x)` throws too, satisfying "expect throw" for the wrong reason. Surfaced in P0.6 confirm-RED. Lead any such test with a **positive guard** (`Schema.parse(validInput)` must SUCCEED) so it fails loudly if the export ever disappears or the schema breaks wholesale. This is load-bearing in a contract-heavy codebase where most slices carry reject-out-of-set / strict-unknown tests.

**Rule:** Any test that is all-negative (every case expects rejection) opens with a positive assertion that a valid input parses, so a vanished/garbage export can't make the rejections false-pass.

## <a id="11"></a>11. An allowlist/registry safety invariant is pinned two ways — non-executing BY SHAPE + a single-source fail-safe gate with own-property lookup

**Date:** 2026-06-20.
**Source slice:** contract track P0.7 (`83db38d`); `packages/contracts/src/checks/check-runner-adapter.ts`.

Key safety rule #3 (no arbitrary code execution; REQ-S-003) is pinned two complementary ways in the frozen contract. (1) **Non-executing BY SHAPE:** `CheckRunnerAdapter` is a `z.strictObject` of pure descriptor fields (`{id, checkType, subtype?, label?}`), so a code-carrying field (`exec`/`command`/`handler`/`fn`/`script`/`code`) is **unrepresentable** — rejected at parse and caught as a regression by the field-set snapshot (lesson §9 applied to rule #3). (2) **Single-source fail-safe gate:** `resolveCheckAdapter(registry, request)` is the one place an adapter id resolves; an unregistered id fails safe to a **schema-valid `skipped` CheckResult** (never executes, never throws).

The load-bearing subtlety: the lookup uses **own-property** semantics (`Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(registry, id)`), not `registry[id]`. A naive `registry[id]` returns truthy `Object.prototype` members for `__proto__`/`constructor`/`toString`/`hasOwnProperty`, **falsely "resolving" a non-adapter and bypassing the allowlist** — verified by the security-reviewer to fail safe to `skipped` even under live `Object.prototype` poisoning. The skip `reason` is a **fixed constant** (`unregistered_adapter`), never the untrusted adapter id (no attacker-controlled-byte reflection, consistent with the "ids are untrusted bytes" rule). Corollary: a conditional-required field is pinned as an **IFF** (`skipReason` present ⟺ `status==='skipped'`) so the nonsensical non-skipped-with-reason state is unrepresentable too.

**Rule:** Pin an allowlist/registry invariant twice — (a) non-executing by shape (`z.strictObject` makes a code field unrepresentable) AND (b) a single-source pure gate that fails safe to a schema-valid skip on an unregistered id, using `hasOwnProperty.call` own-property lookup so `__proto__`/`constructor` ids can't bypass it and never reflecting the untrusted id into the reason.

## <a id="12"></a>12. Immutability-via-versioning is pinned structurally — a source carries a `version`; every artifact it produces carries a REQUIRED `<thing>Version` of identical type

**Date:** 2026-06-20.
**Source slice:** contract track P0.8 (`837e5be`); `packages/contracts/src/scoring/fitness-score.ts`.

Rule #6 (the scoring policy is immutable to agents — anti-reward-hacking) is supported at the contract tier by **versioning, not in-place mutation**. `ScoringPolicy` carries a `version`; `FitnessScore.policyVersion` is REQUIRED and identically typed, so every score is bound to the exact policy that produced it — a score cannot be emitted unbound, and a policy is never edited in place (a change is a new version). This makes selection explainable (a score forever references its policy) and makes "the metric moved under the agents" detectable (a score's `policyVersion` is fixed). Pinned **dually**: the field-set snapshot proves `policyVersion` is present, and a behavioral test proves it's required (rejects when omitted) — guarding against a future weakening-to-optional. The value-level bind (a `policyVersion` equals some live policy's `version`) + write-access immutability are runtime (P5); the contract pins the structural half. (We chose NOT to extract a shared `PolicyVersion` symbol — it's a primitive string with no members to drift, unlike a closed union, lesson §5; revisit only if `version` gains a format constraint.)

**Rule:** Pin immutability-via-versioning structurally — the source carries a `version`, every produced artifact carries a REQUIRED `<thing>Version` of identical type (snapshot proves present + behavioral test proves required) — so the source is never mutated in place and each artifact is forever bound to + explainable against its exact version.

## <a id="13"></a>13. An authoritative-once-computed value is a REQUIRED persisted field + its provenance, so replay reads it and never recomputes

**Date:** 2026-06-20.
**Source slice:** contract track P0.8 (`837e5be`); `packages/contracts/src/scoring/novelty-score.ts`.

Rule #7 (replay calls no providers) is supported at the contract tier by making the expensive-once-computed value a **REQUIRED** persisted field plus the provenance needed to interpret it. `NoveltyScore.vector` (the embedding) is a required `array<number>`, and `embeddingModelId` + `dimension` are required too — so a `NoveltyScore` cannot validate without its persisted vector, and replay reads the stored vector rather than re-calling the embedding provider. The schema makes the optional-vector failure mode unrepresentable; the `length === dimension` relationship stays a kernel check (lesson §6). Generalizes to any persist-once value on the replay path (RNG outcomes, provider results, retrieval hits).

**Rule:** Make an authoritative-once-computed value (embeddings, RNG outcomes, provider/retrieval results) a REQUIRED field + its provenance in the contract, so it can't be omitted and the replay path reads it instead of recomputing (rule #7).

## <a id="14"></a>14. Format/lint/type checks must run the PACKAGE-PINNED binary — `npx prettier` can resolve a different version and report false-clean

**Date:** 2026-06-20.
**Source slice:** contract track contract-001 `/session-end` (`609cb9d`).

A per-slice Step-8 `npx prettier --check` resolved a DIFFERENT prettier than the workspace-pinned binary and reported **false-clean** on 10 files (Unicode in code comments shifted line-wrap past print-width); the authoritative `pnpm format:check` caught it only at `/session-end`, forcing a separate formatting-only commit (`609cb9d`). `npx <tool>` resolves the first match on `PATH` or fetches a "latest" — not necessarily the version pinned in the workspace — so version skew yields different rules: a check that passes locally while the pinned binary (CI / `/preflight`) fails. Always run the workspace-pinned binary: `pnpm format:check` / `pnpm lint` / `pnpm typecheck`, or `./node_modules/.bin/<tool>` — never bare `npx prettier`/`npx eslint`/`npx tsc`.

**Rule:** Run format/lint/type checks through the package-pinned binary (`pnpm <script>` or `./node_modules/.bin/<tool>`), never `npx <tool>` — `npx` can resolve a different version and report false-clean.

## <a id="15"></a>15. Per-type narrowing is a SEPARATE layer over the frozen envelope — a type→schema map + own-property resolver, fail-OPEN to generic, fail-CLOSED on a known-type mismatch

**Date:** 2026-06-20.
**Source slice:** contract track P0.10 (`73289fd`); `packages/contracts/src/events/payload-map.ts`.

`RunEventEnvelope.payload` is generic JSONB (`z.record(z.string(), z.unknown())`) at the envelope level; the six high-traffic event types (§4) need their payload narrowed to a frozen Appendix-A model so the SAME schema validates the event-store write and the model. The narrowing is built as a SEPARATE layer (`payload-map.ts`) — it never mutates the frozen P0.1 envelope. `HIGH_TRAFFIC_PAYLOAD_MAP: Partial<Record<RunEventType, ZodType>>` maps each high-traffic type to its model; `resolvePayloadSchema(type)` returns the narrowed schema for a high-traffic type and the generic schema otherwise.

The resolver fails two ways by design: fail-OPEN to the generic JSONB schema for any non-high-traffic type (an unknown/new type still validates as generic — the registry is the closure, not the resolver), and fail-CLOSED (reject) when a high-traffic type's payload doesn't match its narrowed model (a malformed high-traffic event can't slip through as generic). The lookup is own-property (`Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call`, lesson §11) so a crafted `type` like `__proto__`/`constructor` resolves to generic, never a borrowed schema off the prototype chain. The key-set + per-key mapping is snapshot-pinned so a high-traffic type can't be added/remapped silently. Downstream (the P1 append path) calls the composed `validateEventPayload(type, payload)` before append.

**Rule:** Narrow a generic envelope payload in a SEPARATE layer (type→schema map + own-property resolver), never by mutating the frozen envelope; fail OPEN to generic for unknown types, fail CLOSED on a known-type mismatch; snapshot the map.

## <a id="16"></a>16. A payload-DoS ceiling is a BOUNDED security primitive — depth-BEFORE-size (stringify recurses), iterative early-exit, true-byte count, result-object — not a Zod range

**Date:** 2026-06-20.
**Source slice:** contract track P0.10 (`73289fd`, follow-up `c33eb2f`); `packages/contracts/src/events/payload-map.ts`.

The envelope payload had no size/depth bound (P0.1 security review). `enforcePayloadCeiling(payload)` adds one as a pure result-object primitive (`{ok:true}` | `{ok:false, violation}`), NOT a Zod range refinement — a DoS bound is a security check the append path emits an event on, not a parse-time range (lesson §6: ranges that protect against a buggy producer are kernel rules; this is a security bound the contract owns and the append path calls).

Two non-obvious load-bearing properties: (1) it checks DEPTH BEFORE SIZE, because `JSON.stringify` itself recurses and would stack-overflow on a deeply-nested attacker payload BEFORE a size check could run — the depth check is an iterative explicit-stack walk that early-exits the instant depth exceeds the limit, never fully traversing pathological input. (2) the size check uses `Buffer.byteLength(s, 'utf8')` (true UTF-8 bytes), not `s.length` (UTF-16 code units, which under-counts multibyte/supplementary chars up to ~4× and makes the ceiling looser than its byte label). The whole thing is wrapped so an unserializable payload (BigInt, circular ref) becomes a violation, never a throw. Constants are literal-value-snapshot-pinned so a silent weakening of the bound is a test-breaking, reviewable change.

**Rule:** A payload-DoS ceiling is a bounded pure primitive (depth-before-size; iterative early-exit so deep input can't stack-overflow stringify; true-byte `Buffer.byteLength`; result-object never-throws; literal-pinned constants) that the append path calls — not a Zod range.

## <a id="17"></a>17. An agent-immutable anchor stacks ALL the immutability legs — closed-enum set + literal-true flag + required version + no-authority-field-via-strict + member/field snapshot

**Date:** 2026-06-20.
**Source slice:** contract track P0.15 FinalJudgeRubric (`5058400`); `packages/contracts/src/verifier/final-judge-rubric.ts`.

The held-out judge's rubric is the bedrock fitness anchor agents cannot move (safety rule #6). The contract pins immutability by SHAPE by stacking every leg at once — none alone is sufficient: a closed `z.enum` axis set (no agent can add/remove a judging axis, lesson §1), `immutableToAgents: z.literal(true)` (the flag can't be flipped or omitted), a REQUIRED `policyVersion` typed identically to `ScoringPolicy.version` (immutability-via-versioning, lesson §12 — never mutated in place), `z.strictObject` with no mutation/override/authority field representable (lesson §9), and a field-set + member-set + literal-value snapshot so any weakening is a cross-track regression (lesson §1).

The contract pins SHAPE only — completeness (the rubric carries the full axis set) and the no-agent-write-path are RUNTIME invariants (lesson §6) the P4/P5 held-out-judge LOAD path enforces (load from immutable config; assert the full axis set + `immutableToAgents:true` before scoring). The contract is defense-in-depth; the load path is the primary gate.

**Rule:** For a contract that must be immutable to agents, stack all the legs — closed-enum set + `literal(true)` flag + required identical-typed version + strict no-authority-field + value/member snapshot — and pin completeness + the no-write-path at the runtime load boundary.

## <a id="18"></a>18. A boundary validator returns the PARSED value, never the caller's input — else a transform/coercion silently bypasses on the authoritative path

**Date:** 2026-06-20.
**Source slice:** contract track P0.10 follow-up (`c33eb2f`); `packages/contracts/src/events/payload-map.ts`.

`validateEventPayload(type, payload)` originally returned `{ok:true, payload}` echoing the CALLER's input object rather than `parsed.data` from the `safeParse`. Functionally identical TODAY (no high-traffic schema uses `.transform`/`.coerce`/`.default`), but a latent data-integrity hole on the authoritative event log: the instant any schema gains a coercion, the P1 append path would persist the PRE-transform value — a TOCTOU between validate and use. A validator at a persistence boundary must return the validated/normalized output, so what was checked is exactly what flows downstream. (Surfaced as a phase-exit code-quality [medium]; fixed before the freeze closed.)

**Rule:** A boundary validator returns `parsed.data` (the validated/normalized value), never the caller's input — so a present-or-future transform/coercion can't bypass onto the authoritative path.

## <a id="19"></a>19. Amending a frozen closed contract = a SOLO invariant slice (extend enum + schemaVersion bump + member-set snapshot + fixture re-record), spec authored first, BEFORE downstream forks

**Date:** 2026-06-21.
**Source slice:** contract track P0.1-amend (`dc493a3`); `packages/contracts/src/events/event-type.ts` + `src/version.ts`.

A frozen §2.5 contract sometimes needs amending after its freeze seal but before the dependent tracks fork — here `RunEventType` was missing the operation-start observability markers the architecture+plan required. Doing it BEFORE the fork is the cheap path: forking from a freeze the plan already contradicts guarantees a post-fork `schemaVersion` bump + a cross-track Finding to reconcile across every track that already forked.

The playbook: (1) the orchestrator authors the amendment SPEC into the worktree docs FIRST (`ARCHITECTURE.md` §-sections + Appendix-A row + `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` criterion/emit-bullets), from the authoritative source, so `spec-lint` + the schema-snapshot check against the right spec; (2) the implementer runs it as a SOLO invariant `/tdd` slice — extend the closed enum, bump `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`, update the member-set snapshot, re-record affected fixtures — preserving the contract's invariants (closure still rejects-unlisted, RISK-006; any safety semantic like rule-#8 no-energy-debit); (3) `security-reviewer` FAN OUT (a closed-union + safety semantics are invariant-touching); (4) re-run `/phase-exit` **delta-scoped** for an additive change (the prior full fan-out stands for the unchanged surface — verify the new members agree code↔snapshot↔doc) + re-seal. An additive enum + schemaVersion bump is **non-breaking** when readers accept `schemaVersion ≤ current` (old fixtures still validate) — a `feat`, not a `feat!`.

**Rule:** Amend a frozen contract before downstream forks, as a SOLO invariant slice: author the spec into the docs first, then extend the closed enum + bump `schemaVersion` + update the member-set snapshot + re-record fixtures (closure + safety semantics preserved; additive = non-breaking); re-`/phase-exit` delta-scoped + re-seal.

## <a id="20"></a>20. A subsystem seam = a TS interface over the frozen contracts, conformance-tested via `CANONICAL_FIXTURES` with a registry binding; first impl + first consumer deferred (explicit-deferral wiring)

**Date:** 2026-06-20.
**Source slice:** kernel track P2.1 (`kernel-002`; commit hash recorded at round close); `apps/api/src/model-gateway/port.ts` + `index.ts`.

The kernel CONSUMES the §2.5 contracts the contract track froze; this is the first consumer-side pattern (lessons §1–§19 are all authoring-side). A subsystem seam — the `ModelGateway` port here, the event-store writer / projection readers later — is defined consumer-side as a **TypeScript interface whose method I/O types ARE the frozen contracts** (imported from `@doppl/contracts`, never redefined — the consumer-side extension of lesson §5). The seam surface exposes **no vendor/infra type** — only the frozen Request/Response + capability — so domain importers depend on contracts alone (key safety rule #9, forbidden-pattern #2). The package barrel (`src/model-gateway/index.ts`) is the **one internal seam-import surface**; the backend-internal port stays OUT of the package's public barrel.

A type-only interface has no runtime behavior to unit-test, so conformance is pinned three ways at once: an **in-test minimal fake `implements` the port** (compile-time conformance — a drift between the port and the contract types fails `tsc`), PLUS runtime asserts that the fake's I/O `safeParse`s under the frozen Zod schemas, PLUS a **`CANONICAL_FIXTURES` registry binding** (`.toBe(canonicalValue(name))`, or `.toEqual` if the registry rebuilds the object). The registry binding is load-bearing and NOT optional: `safeParse` alone passes for ANY same-shaped object, so without the binding a drift between a named fixture and the P0.14 registry value would slip through. With it, a frozen-contract field change breaks the kernel's seam test loudly — the consumer-side half of the P0.14 consumer/producer agreement.

A seam defined ahead of its implementations has no production entry point yet — its Step-7.5 wiring is the **explicit-deferral form** ("`none — first impl in <slice>, first consumer in <slice>`"), and every deferred target must be a **named, real plan task** (never silently unreachable). For P2.1: first impl P2.9 (fake) / P2.5 (OpenRouter), first consumer P3 runtime, `ModelRoute` first consumed by P2.2.

**Rule:** Define a subsystem seam as a TS interface over the frozen contracts (I/O types imported, never redefined; no vendor/infra type in the surface — rule #9); conformance-test it with an in-test fake `implements` + `safeParse` + a `CANONICAL_FIXTURES` registry binding so a frozen-shape drift breaks loudly; wire via the explicit-deferral form with every first-impl/first-consumer named as a real task.

## <a id="21"></a>21. The env-value redaction layer is boundary-local and MUST cover object KEYS — the event payload is an open-key `z.record`, so producer-controlled keys reach the append path

**Date:** 2026-06-20.
**Source slice:** kernel track P1.2 (`kernel-003`; commit hash recorded at round close); `apps/api/src/event-store/redaction.ts`.

The frozen `scrubSecrets` (LESSONS 3) covers the key-format + key-name layers but is pure, so it cannot do the **env-value** layer — matching payload strings against the actual loaded `process.env` secret values. That layer is the SOLE defense for a non-format secret (a DB password matches no `sk-`/`Bearer` pattern and sits under no sensitive key-name). It lands at each persistence boundary (event-store before append — this slice; observability before Langfuse emit — P6.5), composing the frozen scrub + a local env-value pass over **injected** secret values (boot loads `process.env`; the function stays pure — LESSONS 4).

The trap (a [high] rule-#4 finding caught at Step 8): scoping the env-value pass to string VALUES + array elements only — on the premise that object keys are schema field names — LEAKS. `RunEventEnvelope.payload` is `z.record(z.string(), z.unknown())` and `GENERIC_PAYLOAD_SCHEMA` for the 30/36 non-high-traffic event types is the same open-key record, so **producer-controlled keys are on the real append path**, and a non-format secret used as a key survives verbatim into the authoritative log. The pass MUST redact secret values in keys too, **with de-collision** (the `[REDACTED]#2` suffix shape, implemented boundary-side since the frozen scrub is immutable) so two keys redacting alike don't collapse (the LESSONS-3 key-collision data-loss bug, not reintroduced).

Two more boundary-layer requirements: (a) an **empty/short secret-value guard** — filter blank + sub-threshold (≥8 chars) entries before matching, or a missing/blank env var turns every payload string into `[REDACTED]` (catastrophic over-redaction — `''.includes` matches everywhere); also drop any "secret" that is a substring of `REDACTION_PLACEHOLDER` (idempotency bulletproof). (b) **literal substring replacement** (`split`/`join`, never a built `RegExp`) so an arbitrary secret value carrying regex metacharacters can't ReDoS or mis-escape.

**Rule:** The env-value redaction layer is boundary-local (the pure frozen scrub can't host it): compose the frozen `scrubSecrets` + a local pass over INJECTED secret values that redacts values + array elements + **object keys (with de-collision)** — keys are producer-controlled because the event payload is an open-key `z.record`; guard empty/short secret values (≥8 + placeholder-substring) and match by literal substring replacement, never a built regex.

## <a id="22"></a>22. Verify the schema before narrowing a safety scrub's scope; aim the adversarial reviewer at exactly the boundary you narrowed

**Date:** 2026-06-20.
**Source slice:** kernel track P1.2 (`kernel-003`; commit hash recorded at round close).

At Step 2.5 the team proposed and the orchestrator blessed narrowing the env-value redaction to values-only, on an UNVERIFIED reachability premise ("payload keys are schema field names, so a secret-as-key is unreachable"). The premise was false — the payload is an open-key `z.record` (§21) — and a values-only scrub is a rule-#4 leak. Two disciplines each would have caught it: (a) **verify the reachability premise against the actual schema** before narrowing a safety primitive's scope (one read of `envelope.ts` / `payload-map.ts` shows the open-key record); (b) when you DO narrow, **point the Step-8 adversarial reviewer at exactly the narrowed boundary** — here the orchestrator's Step-2.5 reply explicitly told the `security-reviewer` to validate the values-only scope, and that directed pass reproduced the leak with evidence and overturned the call.

The posture: a scope-narrowing on a safety invariant (caps, redaction, allowlist, injection-isolation, the held-out judge) is the highest-risk kind of "optimization" — it removes defense. Treat the narrowing premise as a claim to verify against schema/code, not intuition, and aim the adversarial review at the exact thing you removed. Defer to verified evidence when it overturns the call (root `CLAUDE.md` phantom/evidence-deference).

**Rule:** Before narrowing a safety primitive's scope, verify the reachability premise against the actual schema/code; when you narrow, point the Step-8 adversarial reviewer at exactly that boundary; defer to verified counter-evidence.

## <a id="23"></a>23. The gateway structured-output discipline — validate → accept (parsed value) / repair ≤1 (output as `wrapUntrusted` DATA, never in the instruction) / reject (caller persists, gateway emits nothing)

**Date:** 2026-06-20.
**Source slice:** kernel track P2.4 (`kernel-004`; commit hash recorded at round close); `apps/api/src/model-gateway/structured-output.ts` + `gateway.ts`.

The gateway validates a model output against its request Zod schema and returns a frozen `ModelGatewayResponse` (`validationResult` ∈ `accepted|repaired|rejected`; `providerMeta` on every response; `rejection` iff rejected). On a schema failure it makes **exactly one** repair attempt — a structural single-`await` bound, NOT a counter or a loop, so "≤1" cannot drift. Accepted/repaired returns `parsed.data` (the validated/normalized value — lesson §18 — onto the authoritative path, never the raw output).

The rule-#5 isolation in the repair prompt is the load-bearing part: the invalid output is carried as DATA in a sentinel-wrapped **user** message via the FROZEN `wrapUntrusted` / `CRITIC_INPUT_SENTINEL` (lessons §5/§8 — reuse the single-source isolation primitive, do NOT invent a gateway-local sentinel), while the **system** message holds the repair instruction (schema + error) only. So untrusted model text never reaches an instruction string, and an output embedding the sentinel can't break out (`wrapUntrusted` neutralizes it — exactly-twice bound, §8). A still-invalid or non-repairable output (null/empty/transport-failure — nothing to repair) → `accepted=false` + `rejection`; the **caller** (not the gateway) persists `output_schema_rejected`, routing the raw output through the persistence-boundary scrub (P1.2). The gateway itself **emits/persists/debits nothing** — no event-store coupling, no energy accounting (rule #8 success-only debit is the kernel's job, P3.5), no vendor SDK (rule #9). The opaque `request.schema` (`z.unknown()`) is narrowed to a `ZodType` at the gateway boundary (an injected `resolveSchema`); a minimal `createGateway` shell composes the port + discipline around an injected `providerCall` + `capabilityFor` so the registry (P2.2) / real adapter (P2.5) / first consumer (P3) inject later.

**Rule:** The gateway structured-output discipline = validate against the request schema → accept (return `parsed.data`, §18) / repair ≤1 (invalid output as `wrapUntrusted` DATA in a user message, instruction in the system message only — rule #5; reuse the FROZEN sentinel §5/§8, never a local one) / reject (caller persists `output_schema_rejected` through the P1.2 scrub); ≤1 is a structural single-`await` bound; the gateway emits/persists/debits nothing.

## <a id="24"></a>24. Fake a seam by faking the PROVIDER layer fed into the REAL discipline — not by re-implementing the port; keep the fake stateless + deterministic

**Date:** 2026-06-21.
**Source slice:** kernel track P2.9 (`kernel-005`; commit hash recorded at round close); `apps/api/src/model-gateway/stub/`.

The deterministic fork artifact (the fake `ModelGateway` the verifier/selection/demo tracks run against) is built by injecting a fake `providerCall` + `capabilityFor` into the REAL `createGateway` — so the stub runs the genuine validate/repair/reject discipline (§23). A standalone port re-implementation would duplicate the discipline and silently drift from production; faking only the provider/IO layer means the fake CANNOT diverge from real behavior. Drive the accept/repair/reject paths via the fake provider's OUTPUT (a `mode: valid|repairable|reject` choosing schema-passing / first-invalid-then-valid / persistently-invalid raw output), never by bypassing the discipline.

Determinism is a hard requirement for a fork/replay artifact: two stub instances must be byte-identical for the same config + request. The trap is a cross-call counter ("first call invalid, second valid") — two instances with independent counters diverge. Instead detect the discipline's repair call STATELESSLY: the discipline's repair request carries the invalid output wrapped in the frozen `CRITIC_INPUT_SENTINEL` (§23 / rule #5), so the fake returns invalid when the sentinel is absent (initial call) and valid when present (repair call) — no state, fully deterministic. The fake reads no env (`selectGateway` takes a resolved `{useStub}`; the `defaults<file<env` resolution is the boot caller's via `validateRunConfig` — lesson §4).

**Rule:** Fake a seam by faking the provider/IO layer fed into the REAL discipline/orchestration (never re-implement the port — it drifts); drive valid/repairable/reject through the fake provider's output, not by bypassing the discipline; keep the fake stateless + deterministic (detect a repair call via the sentinel in the message, NOT a cross-call counter) and env-free (selection config is resolved by the boot caller).

## <a id="25"></a>25. DB append-only enforcement = a row-level (UPDATE/DELETE) trigger + a statement-level (TRUNCATE) trigger AND a least-privilege role — the trigger alone is privilege-defeatable

**Date:** 2026-06-21.
**Source slice:** kernel track P1.4 (`kernel-006`; commit hash recorded at round close); `apps/api/src/event-store/migrations/` + `migrate.ts`.

Rule #2's append-only guarantee for `run_events` is enforced at the DB, and making it COMPLETE took three things, not one:

- A **row-level `BEFORE UPDATE OR DELETE` trigger** that `RAISE`s (catches the obvious mutations; verified it also blocks upsert / CTE-delete / join-update bypasses).
- A **statement-level `BEFORE TRUNCATE` trigger** — a row-level trigger CANNOT catch `TRUNCATE`, which would silently wipe the whole log. (Found at Step 8; closed in-slice — never ship a known append-only gap.)
- A **least-privilege DB role**: triggers are privilege-dependent — a **superuser OR the table owner** defeats them on its own connection (`SET session_replication_role='replica'` or `ALTER TABLE … DISABLE TRIGGER ALL`, both verified on the container). So the runtime MUST connect as a non-owner/non-superuser app role, with migrations run as a separate owner/admin role. The trigger is necessary but NOT sufficient without the role split. ([high] finding at P1.4 Step 8 → folded into P3 + a §9/§14 arch note; not fixable in the migration slice — there's no runtime connection/role layer yet.)

**testcontainers harness** (the kernel's real-PG integration pattern): integration tests run against a real Dockerized Postgres (no mocks on the load-bearing path, §16) via a **shared container booted once in a Vitest `globalSetup`** (migrate once, share the URI through `provide`/`inject`); the Vitest config is **split** — unit-only default so `pnpm test`/`test:unit`/`/preflight` stay fast + Docker-free, plus a separate integration config for the container suite (`test:integration`). Drizzle-generated migration artifacts go in `.prettierignore`. Op note: a wedged Docker engine (persistent 500 on `/_ping`) is HOST-side — only a Docker Desktop restart clears it; don't burn cycles on CLI daemon-recovery.

**Rule:** Enforce append-only at the DB with BOTH a row-level UPDATE/DELETE trigger AND a statement-level TRUNCATE trigger, AND a least-privilege runtime role (non-owner/non-superuser; migrations as a separate owner) — the trigger alone is privilege-defeatable. Integration-test against a real PG via a shared testcontainers container (`globalSetup`), with the Vitest config split so `/preflight` stays Docker-free.

## <a id="26"></a>26. The authoritative append path is ONE transaction (validate → ceiling → scrub-on-parsed → advisory-lock sequence → insert); the writer exposes only append + ordered-read; error messages never echo payload

**Date:** 2026-06-21.
**Source slice:** kernel track P1.3 (`kernel-007`; commit hash recorded at round close); `apps/api/src/event-store/{append.ts, sequence.ts, index.ts}`.

The sole authoritative write to `run_events` is ONE transaction, in this order: (1) **validate** the envelope against `RunEventEnvelope.omit({sequence, occurredAt})` — both are server/DB-assigned, so the caller can't supply them (safe-by-construction: a caller can't set the ordering key OR the log clock); (2) **`validateEventPayload`** (per-type narrow + size/depth ceiling) — on `{ok:false}` the writer **REJECTS** with a typed `AppendError{reason}` and the CALLER (the kernel) emits the violation event (the writer stays a pure mechanism — append/read only, never event semantics); (3) **`scrubSecrets` on the PARSED payload** (lesson §18 — scrub what you persist, the validated value) BEFORE the insert (rule #4 — the only insert site, so no payload reaches disk unscrubbed); (4) **allocate** a per-run monotonic gapless sequence; (5) **insert**.

Sequence allocation under concurrency: `pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext(run_id))` at the top of the txn + `COALESCE(MAX(sequence)+1, 0)` — the lock serializes same-run appends (released at commit) and different `run_id`s hash to different locks so cross-run appends don't contend. This closes the READ COMMITTED TOCTOU between `MAX(sequence)` and the insert (verified: 100 concurrent appends across two independent pools → `0..99`, no dup/gap/deadlock); the `unique(run_id, sequence)` constraint (P1.4) is the backstop. The writer's surface is exactly `{append, readByRun}` — no update/delete path; ids are opaque parameterized columns everywhere (incl. the raw `sql` in the allocator). `secretValues` is injected (IO at the boundary, §4).

**Forward-guard (rule #4):** an `AppendError` that interpolates a Zod error message is safe ONLY while payload validation is a SEPARATE step from the envelope `safeParse` — today the `schema_invalid` message can't carry payload content. If a future change folds payload validation INTO the envelope parse, that error message would echo payload bytes (a secret-leak vector on an error path the scrub doesn't cover). Keep payload content out of authoritative-path error messages.

**Rule:** The authoritative append is one txn — validate (omit the server/DB-assigned `sequence`+`occurredAt`) → ceiling (reject `{ok:false}`, caller emits the event) → scrub the parsed payload → advisory-lock-serialized sequence (`pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext(run_id))` + `COALESCE(MAX+1,0)`) → insert; the writer exposes only append + ordered-read; ids parameterized; authoritative-path error messages never echo payload content.

## <a id="27"></a>27. A projection is a PURE ordered fold over (runId, sequence) → a watermark-tagged, byte-stable result; ASSERT strict ordering (never silently fold/re-sort), and staleness is a pure predicate

**Date:** 2026-06-21.
**Source slice:** demo track P6.1 (`demo-001`; commit hash recorded at round close); `apps/api/src/projections/{projection-builder,watermark,index}.ts` + `packages/contracts/src/projections/projection-watermark.ts`.

The read side mirrors the write side's discipline (§26): a projection builder is a generic, reducer-injected **pure** fold — `buildProjection(events, reducer, init) → WatermarkedProjection<S> {runId, sequenceThrough, state}` — and being a pure function of the persisted log is what makes it **rebuildable, never authoritative** (rule #2) and **replay-safe** (rule #7 — the builder imports no `ModelGateway`/provider/embedding, pinned by a positive-guarded no-import test, §10). Determinism is pinned by an exported `canonicalize(value)` (deterministic JSON, recursively-sorted keys): the same events fold to a **byte-identical** serialization (state-equivalence), and the canonical form is the shared comparison basis P6.4 (replay-summary) reuses.

The load-bearing posture is **assert-not-resort**: the ordered reader (`readByRun`) already returns `asc(sequence)`, so the builder does NOT silently re-sort — it **asserts** strict consecutive monotonic ordering (baseline = the run's first observed sequence, then strict `+1`) and surfaces any violation as a typed, closed-reason `ProjectionError` (`empty | mixed_run | schema_version_unsupported | sequence_gap | sequence_non_monotonic`) rather than producing a partial projection. Silently re-sorting or skipping would mask a producer/reader bug — surface it (the §6 schema-vs-kernel split spirit, applied to the read path). schemaVersion is gated like §4 readers: accept all `≤ CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`, **reject** a higher one (never fold an envelope the builder can't interpret). A per-run fold also rejects zero events (no derivable watermark) and cross-run contamination.

Staleness is split pure-vs-IO like the rest of the area: a **pure** `isStale(watermark, latestSequence)` predicate (rebuild whenever events exist with `sequence` > the watermark) + a **thin parameterized** boundary helper `latestSequence(db, runId)` (Drizzle `max()`+`eq` — `runId` is opaque untrusted bytes, never string-concatenated into SQL; IDs-opaque carry-forward, demo portion). The watermark itself is a frozen demo-track-local contract `ProjectionWatermark` (strict `{runId, sequenceThrough:int≥0}`, `sequenceThrough` typed to match `LineageGraphProjection`) with its own `spec(§9)` field-name snapshot — kept in `test/projections/`, NOT the Appendix-A seam gate, because it is not a §2.5 cross-track seam model.

**Rule:** Build a projection as a generic reducer-injected PURE fold over `(runId, sequence)` → a watermark-tagged result; pin determinism with an exported `canonicalize` (sorted-key JSON, byte-stable); ASSERT strict consecutive monotonic ordering + reject `schemaVersion > current` + reject empty/mixed-run as a typed closed-reason error (never silently fold, re-sort, or skip); make the rebuild path provider-free (rule #7, no-import test); split staleness into a pure `isStale(watermark, latestSequence)` predicate + a thin parameterized DB max-sequence helper (runId opaque).

## <a id="28"></a>28. A second persistence boundary mirrors the first EXACTLY — same ceiling-then-scrub order, same env-value layer; an injected-IO boundary fails safe and never writes the authoritative log

**Date:** 2026-06-21.
**Source slice:** demo track P6.5 (`demo-002`; commit hash recorded at round close); `packages/observability/src/{redaction,emit,index}.ts`.

Rule #4 / §14 puts a secret-redaction scrub at TWO boundaries — `event-store` before append (P1.2, L21/§26) AND `observability` before Langfuse emit (this slice). The architecture decision is that the env-value layer is **boundary-local** (the frozen `scrubSecrets` in `@doppl/contracts` stays pure — key-format + key-name only; the env-value layer that matches loaded `process.env` secret values is applied where env loads). So the observability twin **re-composes** the env-value layer locally (`scrubObservabilityPayload` = frozen `scrubSecrets` + the same env-value pass over **keys + array elements + string values, de-collision, ≥8/placeholder guard, literal split/join, proto-safe `Object.defineProperty` rebuild**) — mirroring `scrubEventPayload` rather than hoisting to the frozen package or importing the kernel-owned twin.

The load-bearing catch (security-reviewer [medium], closed in-slice): **mirroring the scrub is not enough — you must mirror the WHOLE boundary discipline.** The event-store boundary runs `enforcePayloadCeiling` (depth≤32 / size≤1 MiB, iterative DFS — L16/§26) BEFORE the scrub; the first cut of the observability boundary called only the scrub, and the env-value pass recurses with no depth guard → a deeply-nested payload blows the stack (an availability gap on the non-authoritative side-channel — not a secret leak, but a known boundary asymmetry). Fix: apply the **same frozen `enforcePayloadCeiling` before the scrub**, dropping the trace + local-warning on exceed. A second boundary must mirror the first's full ceiling-then-scrub order, not just the scrub.

The boundary INJECTS its IO (`createEmitBoundary({secretValues, emit, warn})` — the Langfuse client is injected, so P2.8 plugs in the real SDK and tests drive a fake; L24) and **fails safe**: a failed export local-warns and writes **NO** authoritative-log entry (§13 — Langfuse is non-authoritative), structurally pinned by a test that `emit.ts` imports nothing from `event-store`/`drizzle`/`pg`. **Cross-track:** this is the canonical Langfuse-boundary scrub — P2.8 imports it, never reimplements (two divergent copies = the L21 key-leak class; §2.5-seam Finding). Two boundaries now share the env-value pattern byte-for-byte — extract a shared **pure** helper only at a THIRD boundary (P6.10 kernel-logger), YAGNI until then.

**Rule:** When a safety scrub lands at a second boundary, mirror the first boundary's FULL discipline — same `enforcePayloadCeiling`-then-scrub order (not just the scrub), same boundary-local env-value layer (keys+arrays+values, de-collision, guards) composed over the frozen `scrubSecrets` (never hoist/reimplement); inject the boundary's IO and fail safe (failed export → local warn, never an authoritative-log write, pinned by a no-DB-import test); a cross-track consumer (P2.8) imports the canonical scrub, never duplicates it.

## <a id="29"></a>29. A concrete projection = a reducer INJECTED into the generic fold (never hand-rolled); rows keyed-by-id + SET; the event→entity-transition map is grounded in the FROZEN status enums, and an un-evented transition is deferred, not guessed

**Date:** 2026-06-21.
**Source slice:** demo track P6.2 (`demo-004`; commit hash recorded at round close); `apps/api/src/projections/{current-state.ts, reducers/{state,lifecycle,entities,lineage}.ts}`.

A concrete projection is built by **injecting a reducer into the §27 `buildProjection` fold** — never by re-implementing the fold (that loses the watermark/ordering/schemaVersion guards). The reducer is **immutable** (never mutates the passed initial state — matches `buildProjection`'s reused-initial byte-stable contract) and groups its concerns into per-concern modules (`state`/`lifecycle`/`entities`/`lineage`) composed into one reducer. Current-state rows are **keyed by id and SET** (not appended/incremented), which makes idempotent re-fold structural; high-traffic rows store the **frozen payload entity verbatim** (already validated at append) and read-back persisted values (the novelty vector/embeddingModelId/dimension) **without recomputing** (rule #7, no-provider-import test).

The load-bearing discipline is the **event→entity-transition map**, and the rule is: **ground every transition in the frozen contract, defer what the contract doesn't yet evidence.**
- Terminal/failure events set the **frozen-enum** terminal status (no ad-hoc strings).
- A marker is durable state ONLY if a frozen status enum has the value: `generation.verifying/scoring/reproducing` ARE durable `GenerationStatus` phases (the enum has them — all-no-op would make 3/8 values unreachable), but the other 8 operation-start markers have no durable status field → no-op (the live/SSE view derives their in-flight sub-state, §12 — a SEPARATE transient layer from durable current-state).
- `energy_exhausted` is **mid-flight, not terminal** (§5 graceful-drain → the following `run.completed/failed` sets the run terminal — energy_exhausted alone can't pick completed-vs-failed).
- A **cull** sets `'culled'` STATUS on its targets (a cull has no source→target, so it is NOT an edge); **reproduction** (fusion/mutation/crossover) produces the `lineage_edges` (parent→child).
- Where the contract has a status value but **no event yet evidences the transition** (candidate `under_review/checked/scored`; agenome `active/spent/eligible_parent`), **defer it as a cross-track integration-reconcile carry-forward** (complete it when P3/P4/P5 define the emission) — do NOT guess it from side-effect events (critic.reviewed/check.completed are their own rows, not candidate-status advancers).

**Rule:** Build a concrete projection as an immutable reducer injected into the §27 fold (never hand-rolled); key rows by id and SET (idempotent); store high-traffic rows as the frozen payload verbatim + read persisted values without recompute (rule #7); ground the event→entity-transition map in the frozen status enums (a marker is durable status only if the enum has the value — else no-op for the live view); treat `energy_exhausted` as mid-flight (the explicit lifecycle event sets terminal); cull→status, reproduction→edges; and DEFER an un-evented status transition as an integration-reconcile carry-forward rather than guessing it from side-effects.

## <a id="30"></a>30. A secondary projection is a PURE TRANSFORM of another projection (not a re-fold); a render-bound graph drops dangling edges and pins producer-conformance to the frozen contract

**Date:** 2026-06-21.
**Source slice:** demo track P6.3 (`demo-005`; commit hash recorded at round close); `apps/api/src/projections/lineage-graph.ts`.

A projection that another projection already covers is built as a **pure transform of that projection, not a second fold over the event log**: `buildLineageGraph(currentState) → LineageGraphProjection` maps the §29 current-state rows → nodes/edges and **carries the watermark (`sequenceThrough`) through** — no re-fold (which would duplicate the §27 ordering/schemaVersion guards and risk drift). It produces a **frozen Appendix-A** model (P0.13) as a **PRODUCER**: don't touch `packages/contracts` (the contract + its field-name snapshot are frozen), and pin **producer-conformance** instead — the builder's output `safeParse`s the frozen schema (this IS the §2.5-seam check for a producer; no new snapshot needed).

Two graph-specific lessons for a projection that **feeds a renderer** (React Flow, §10):
- **The edge set is the renderable tree, not just the genealogy.** The spec's "edges from lineage_edges/reproduction" is the *genealogy subset*; a reproduction-only graph leaves candidate/critic/check/score nodes **disconnected** (unrenderable). So edges = authoritative genealogy (lineage_edges) **+ structural derivation connectivity** (generation→agenome→candidate→{critic,check,score}) over the **open** `LineageEdge.type`.
- **Drop dangling edges.** A renderer breaks on an edge to a non-existent node, so emit a structural edge **only when both endpoint nodes exist** in the projection (an orphan critic_review yields its node but no edge to an absent candidate). Node ids assume globally-unique opaque entity ids — pin uniqueness, and namespace by type only if the id source can collide (integration-reconcile).

Node-type discipline: use the **closed** node-type enum; a thing that isn't a node type is encoded as a **status or metric** on a node (the "selected winner" is a candidate node with `status:'selected'`; novelty is a `metric`, not a 7th node type). `dataRef` is a within-tier authoritative pointer (the entity id — never an external URI).

**Rule:** Build a secondary projection as a PURE transform of the projection that already folded the log (carry the watermark through; never re-fold); as a producer of a frozen Appendix-A model, don't touch the contract — pin producer-conformance (`safeParse` the frozen schema). For a render-bound graph, the edge set must connect the tree (genealogy + structural derivation edges), drop edges with a missing endpoint, and encode non-node concepts as status/metric on the closed node-type set.

## <a id="31"></a>31. The replay path IS the rule-#7 surface — narrow the reader type so writes are unreachable, pin no-provider structurally (import-ban + call-shape), re-fold the persisted log, and commit an older-schemaVersion fixture

**Date:** 2026-06-21.
**Source slice:** demo track P6.4 (`demo-007`; commit hash recorded at round close); `apps/api/src/projections/{replay-reader,replay-summary}.ts` + `test/fixtures/replay/older-schema-run.ts`.

KEY SAFETY RULE #7 (replay reconstructs from the persisted log + never calls model/embedding/web providers) is enforced at the **replay path**, and the strongest enforcement is **structural, not behavioral**:

- **Narrow the reader's type so writes are unreachable.** `createReplayReader` takes `Pick<EventStore, 'readByRun'>` — the append method is **not in the type**, so the replay path **structurally cannot write** the authoritative log (rule #2 + #7). A capability you don't hand over can't be misused.
- **Pin no-provider structurally, two ways.** (1) an **import-ban** test: the transitive replay path resolves to only `@doppl/contracts` + relative projection modules + `import type` from `../event-store` (runtime-erased — types don't import the provider); (2) a **call-shape** test: the replay source contains no `fetch(`, no `Math.random(` (no re-sample), no provider/embedding symbol. Behavioral tests (deterministic re-fold, persisted read-back) back these up but the structural pins are the teeth.
- **Re-fold the persisted log; never recompute.** `buildReplaySummary` re-folds via the §27/§29 builders (the schemaVersion-≤-current gate is ON the path, reused not bypassed) and reads RNG outcomes (`ReproductionEvent`/`CullingEvent`), embedding vectors (`novelty.scored`), and retrieval results from their **persisted payloads verbatim** — never re-samples / re-embeds / re-calls.
- **State-equivalence is the determinism contract.** `canonicalize(replay) === canonicalize(captured)` (L27) — true-by-construction when both use the same fold, so it's a determinism *guard*; the no-provider teeth are the structural pins.
- **Commit an older-`schemaVersion` fixture.** A `schemaVersion < current` fixture (v1, pre-marker types) must replay successfully (the ≤-current gate on the path accepts it) — the §16 must-pass that proves forward-compatibility without per-version upcasters.

**Rule:** Enforce rule #7 at the replay path structurally — give the reader a narrowed type (`Pick<EventStore,'readByRun'>`) so writes are unreachable; pin no-provider with an import-ban + a call-shape test (no `fetch(`/`Math.random(`/provider import; `import type` is runtime-erased and fine); re-fold the persisted log via the existing builders (gate reused, not bypassed) reading RNG/embedding/retrieval from persisted payloads verbatim; assert state-equivalence via `canonicalize`; and commit an older-`schemaVersion` fixture that replays.

## <a id="32"></a>32. The REST write path: a sanitizing error boundary + ingestion validation, cap-override rejection (API defense layer), idempotency + one-active-run via the current-state, append-only never project-write

**Date:** 2026-06-21.
**Source slice:** demo track P6.6 (`demo-009`; commit hash recorded at round close); `apps/api/src/{server.ts, routes/runs.ts, middleware/idempotency.ts}`.

The Fastify write path (the Browser→API boundary, §11/§14/§15) folds several boundary disciplines into one bootstrap:

- **Two ingestion gates + a sanitizing error boundary.** A `bodyLimit` rejects oversize requests **before** the per-type payload ceiling (the §14 carry-forward, pairs with P0.10); an instance `setErrorHandler` **sanitizes 5xx** to `{error:'internal_error'}` (no internal message — e.g. a `ProjectionError` from a foreign-producer schemaVersion>current — leaks at the trust boundary) while **4xx pass through** (validation errors are safe + useful). The handler logging the error to **server stdout** (`request.log.error`) is fine — server logs are OUTSIDE the rule-#4 event-log/Langfuse/UI boundary.
- **Validate at ingestion, fail closed, no event on invalid.** `validateRunConfig` (P0.3, the canonical entry) runs in-handler: invalid config → 400, a present **non-object body** (array/string/number) → 400 (only null/undefined → defaults), **no `run.configured` appended** on any reject.
- **Cap overrides are an API DEFENSE layer, not the enforcer.** The endpoint rejects any cap above the validated maxima (the default ceilings; lowering-only). This is defense-in-depth — the KERNEL is the authoritative cap enforcer (rule #1); the API just refuses an over-ceiling override early.
- **Idempotency + one-active-run, both grounded in the authoritative log.** An `Idempotency-Key` header dedupes `POST /runs` (coalesce a duplicate header `string[]`→`[0]`); one-active-run uses an **in-memory hint RE-VALIDATED against the log** (`buildCurrentState(readByRun(activeRunId))` non-terminal → 409) — the in-memory pointer is a hint, the log is the truth. (In-memory is the §5 single-process MVP; persisted/event-keyed dedup + a log-wide active-run scan via the P6.7 list-runs reader are hosted/P3 hardenings.)
- **REST is the sole write path, append-only.** The endpoints append authoritative events via the P1.3 writer ONLY and never mutate a projection (rule #2; pinned structurally — no `.insert`/`.values`/drizzle in the route).

**Rule:** The REST write path bootstraps Fastify with a `bodyLimit` ingestion gate + a `setErrorHandler` that sanitizes 5xx (no internal-message leak; 4xx pass through; server-stdout logging is outside the rule-#4 boundary); validates at ingestion (`validateRunConfig`, reject non-object body, no event on invalid); rejects cap overrides above the validated maxima as a DEFENSE layer (the kernel is the authoritative enforcer); dedupes via an idempotency key + guards one-active-run with an in-memory hint RE-VALIDATED against the authoritative log; and appends authoritative events ONLY, never mutating a projection.

## <a id="33"></a>33. The REST read surface rebuilds on read + returns a clean 404; a cross-track read stays in-area by READ-IMPORTING the other track's schema (never editing its file)

**Date:** 2026-06-21.
**Source slice:** demo track P6.7 (`demo-011`; commit hash recorded at round close); `apps/api/src/routes/{runs-read,model-routes}.ts` + `apps/api/src/projections/run-list.ts`.

The GET read surface registers on the shared P6.6 Fastify server and serves the projections:
- **Rebuild-on-read (MVP).** Each GET REBUILDS its projection from `readByRun` — always fresh (the §27–§31 folds are cheap + pure); the `dashboard_snapshots` cache + the watermark-staleness check are deferred (the P6.1 watermark machinery awaits them). Unknown runId/candidateId → a **clean 404** (never a partial/empty 200). Reads are **read-only** — no append, no projection write (rule #2; pinned).
- **A cross-track read stays in-area by READ-IMPORTING, not editing.** `GET /runs` needs a list-of-runs reader, but the event store (`apps/api/event-store`) is the **kernel track's** area. Rather than add a method to the kernel's `append.ts` (a cross-track edit → merge-conflict risk + coordination), the demo put `listRunIds()` in its **own** area (`apps/api/src/projections/run-list.ts`) that **read-imports** the `runEvents` schema from `../event-store/schema` and runs `selectDistinct({runId})`. A read-only import across the layer is fine (projections → event-store is the allowed direction); only EDITING the other track's file crosses the boundary. This kept the slice self-contained (zero kernel-file edits) and reusable (it also backs P6.6's deferred log-wide active-run scan).

**Rule:** A REST read surface rebuilds each projection from `readByRun` on read (MVP — cache+staleness deferred), returns a clean 404 for an unknown id (never partial/empty 200), and stays read-only (rule #2). When a read needs data owned by another track's area, keep the reader IN YOUR area and **read-import** that area's schema/types — never edit the other track's file (a read-only cross-area import is fine; editing isn't).
